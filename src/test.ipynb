       "{'name': 'Aasimar',\n",
       " 'description': 'Whereas tieflings have fiendish blood in their veins, aasimar are the descendants of celestial beings. These folk generally appear as glorious humans with lustrous hair, flawless skin, and piercing eyes. Aasimar often attempt to pass as humans in order to right wrongs and defend goodness on the Material Plane without drawing undue attention to their celestial heritage. They strive to fit into society, although they usually rise to the top, becoming revered leaders and honorable heroes. You might decide to use the aasimar as a counterpoint to the tiefling race. The two races could even be at odds, reflecting some greater conflict between the forces of good and evil in your campaign. Here are our basic goals for the aasimar: Aasimar should make effective clerics and paladins. Aasimar should be to celestials and humans what tieflings are to fiends and humans. Given that aasimar and tieflings are like two sides of the same coin, the tiefling makes a good starting point for coming up with the new race’s traits. Since we want aasimar to be effective paladins and clerics, it makes sense to improve their Wisdom and Charisma instead of Intelligence and Charisma. Like tieflings, aasimar have darkvision. Instead of resistance to fire damage, we give them resistance to radiant damage to reflect their celestial nature. However, radiant damage isn’t as common as fire damage, so we give them resistance to necrotic damage as well, making them good at facing undead. The tiefling’s Infernal Legacy trait is a good model for a similar trait to reflect a magical, celestial heritage, replacing the tiefling’s spells with spells of similar levels that more closely match the aasimar’s celestial ancestry. However, the aasimar’s expanded resistance might require limiting this trait to basic utility spells. Filling in the remaining details, we end up with the following racial traits for the aasimar: Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2. Age. Aasimar mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer. Alignment. Due to their celestial heritage, aasimar are often good. However, some aasimar fall into evil, rejecting their heritage. Size. Aasimar are built like well-proportioned humans. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Thanks to your celestial heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Celestial Resistance. You have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage. Celestial Legacy. You know the light cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the lesser restoration spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, you can cast the daylight spell once with this trait as a 3rd-level spell, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Celestial.'}"
