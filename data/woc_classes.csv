0,Artificer,"Masters of unlocking magic in everyday objects, artificers are supreme inventors. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled. Artificers use tools to channel arcane power, crafting magical objects. To cast a spell, an artificer could use alchemist’s supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher’s supplies to inscribe a sigil of power on an ally’s armor, or tinker’s tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents. Arcane Science In the world of Eberron, arcane magic has been harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society. Artificers reflect this development. Their knowledge of magical devices, and their ability to infuse mundane items with magic, allows Eberron’s most miraculous projects to continue. During the Last War, artificers were marshaled on a massive scale. Many lives were saved because of the inventions of brave artificers, but countless lives were also lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by their creations. Seekers of New Lore Nothing excites an artificer quite like uncovering a new metal or discovering a source of elemental energy. In artificer circles, new inventions and strange discoveries create the most excitement. Artificers who wish to make their mark must innovate, creating something fresh, rather than iterating on familiar designs. This drive for novelty pushes artificers to become adventurers. Eberron’s main travel routes and populated regions have long since been explored. Thus, artificers seek the frontiers of civilization in hopes of making the next great discovery in arcane research. Artificers in Other Worlds Eberron is the world most associated with artificers, yet the class can be found throughout the D&D multiverse. In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the island of Lantan is home to many artificers, and in the world of Dragonlance, tinker gnomes are often members of this class. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks of the World of Greyhawk have inspired some folk to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep airships and other wondrous devices operational. In the City of Sigil, artificers share discoveries from throughout the cosmos, and one in particular—the gnome inventor Vi—has run a multiverse-spanning business from there since leaving the world of her birth, Eberron. In the world-city Ravnica, the Izzet League trains numerous artificers, the destructiveness of whom is unparalleled in other worlds—except, perhaps, by the tinker gnomes of Krynn. The Magic of Artifice As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray , you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special. The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal , you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy. Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters. Creating an Artificer When creating an artificer, think about your character’s relationship with the artisan who taught them their craft. Does the character have a rival? Talk to your DM about the role played by artificers in the campaign and the sort of organizations you might have ties to. Quick Build You can make an artificer quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Intelligence, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the guild artisan background. Optional Rule: Multiclassing If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook , here’s what you need to know if you choose artificer as one of your classes. Ability Score Minimum. As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already an artificer. Proficiencies Gained. If artificer isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as an artificer: light armor, medium armor, shields, thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools. Spell Slots. Add half your levels (rounded up) in the artificer class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots. Class Features As an artificer, you gain the following class features. Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per artificer level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per artificer level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons Tools: Thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools, one type of artisan’s tools of your choice Saving Throws: Constitution, Intelligence Skills: Choose two from Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Sleight of Hand Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: any two simple weapons of your choice a light crossbow and 20 bolts your choice of studded leather armor or scale mail thieves’ tools and a dungeoneer’s pack If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 5d4 × 10 gp to buy your equipment. Optional Rule: Firearm Proficiency The secrets of creating and operating gunpowder weapons have been discovered in various corners of the D&D multiverse. If your Dungeon Master uses the rules on firearms in chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your artificer is proficient with them.

To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice: The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long. The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away. A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like. The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early. You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies. Spellcasting You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you’re producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions. Tools Required You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an 'M' component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, “Equipment,” in the Player’s Handbook for descriptions of these tools. After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus. Cantrips (0-Level Spells) At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list. Preparing and Casting Spells The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Ritual Casting You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Infuse Item At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items. Infusions Known When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the “Artificer Infusions” section at the end of the class’s description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one. Infusing an Item Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see “Attunement” in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide ). Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one. You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies. If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding , its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space. Artificer Specialist At 3rd level, you choose the type of specialist you are: Alchemist, Artillerist, or Battle Smith, each of which is detailed at the end of the class’s description. Your choice grants you features at 5th level and again at 9th and 15th level. The Right Tool for the Job At 3rd level, you learn how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan’s tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Tool Expertise Starting at 6th level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool. Flash of Genius Starting at 7th level, you gain the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Magic Item Adept When you reach 10th level, you achieve a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items: You can attune to up to four magic items at once. If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold. Spell-Storing Item At 11th level, you learn how to store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn’t have it prepared). While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell’s effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it’s been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object. Magic Item Savant At 14th level, your skill with magic items deepens more: You can attune to up to five magic items at once. You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item. Magic Item Master Starting at 18th level, you can attune to up to six magic items at once. Soul of Artifice At 20th level, you develop a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection: You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to. If you’re reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0. Artificer Specialists Artificers pursue many dis ciplines. Here are specialist options you can choose from at 3rd level.

1,Barbarian,"A Fierce Warrior of Primal Rage Barbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multiverse that manifest as a Rage . More than a mere emotion—and not limited to anger—this Rage is an incarnation of a predator’s ferocity, a storm’s fury, and a sea’s turmoil. Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses. Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection don’t have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventure.

You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren’t wearing Heavy armor . You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table . You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest , and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest . While active, your Rage follows the rules below. Damage Resistance. You have Resistance to Bludgeoning , Piercing , and Slashing damage. Rage Damage. When you make an attack using Strength —with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table . Strength Advantage. You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws . No Concentration or Spells. You can’t maintain Concentration , and you can’t cast spells. Duration. The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following: Make an attack roll against an enemy. Force an enemy to make a saving throw. Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage. Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes. Level 1: Unarmored Defense While you aren’t wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers . You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit. Level 1: Weapon Mastery Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes . Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices. When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian Features table. Level 2: Danger Sense You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition. Level 2: Reckless Attack You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time. Level 3: Barbarian Subclass You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The Path of the Berserker , Path of the Wild Heart , Path of the World Tree , and Path of the Zealot subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Barbarian level or lower. Level 3: Primal Knowledge You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1. In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics , Intimidation , Perception , Stealth , or Survival . When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Extra Attack You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Level 5: Fast Movement Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing Heavy armor. Level 7: Feral Instinct Your instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls. Level 7: Instinctive Pounce As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage , you can move up to half your Speed . Level 9: Brutal Strike If you use Reckless Attack , you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength -based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn’t have Disadvantage . If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike , and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options. Forceful Blow. The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks. Hamstring Blow. The target’s Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—the most recent one. Level 11: Relentless Rage Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw . If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long Rest , the DC resets to 10. Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options. Staggering Blow. The target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn. Sundering Blow. Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus. Level 15: Persistent Rage When you roll Initiative , you can regain all expended uses of Rage . After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor. Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature. Level 18: Indomitable Might If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score , you can use that score in place of the total. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Irresistible Offense is recommended. Level 20: Primal Champion You embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25. Barbarian Subclasses A Barbarian subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain levels, as specified in the subclass.

2,Bard,"Whether poet, scholar, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds. The Inspirations of Adventure Rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves. Creating a Bard What's the story of your past? Were you an apprentice, following another bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced musical magic? Perhaps you were a runaway or an orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost? Quick Build You can make a bard quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the entertainer background.

Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See chapter 4 for the general rules of spellcasting. Cantrips You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table. Spell Slots The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds ⁠ using either slot. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells⁠ of your choice. Each of these spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting⁠ Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one as explained in chapter 4. Ritual Casting You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. See chapter 4 for how rituals work. Spellcasting⁠ Focus You can use a musical instrument (see chapter 3 for examples) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. Bardic Insp⁠i⁠ration You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Insp⁠ira⁠tion die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Insp⁠iration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiratio⁠n die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspir⁠ation die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspira⁠tion die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level. Jack of All Trades Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus. Song of Rest Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points. Bard College At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th. Expertise At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Font of Inspir⁠ation Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspirati⁠on when you finish a short or long rest. Countercharm At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required). Bard Colleges Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions. Subclasses College of Lore College of Valor",Essentials Kit,
3,Cleric,"Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. Healers and Warriors Divine magic⁠, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. Harnessing divine magic⁠ doesn’t rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes. Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat⁠ training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side. Divine Agents Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and streng⁠th of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare. When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because a god demands it. This path often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a fiendish portal. Creating a Cleric As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve. The Divine Domains section at the end of this class description suggests some gods that your cleric might serve. Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric’s relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose you? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special⁠ task in mind for you? Quick Build You can make a cleric quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Strength or Constitution. Second, choose the acolyte background.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per cleric level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per cleric level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light⁠ armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons Tools: None Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma Skills: Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion Equipm⁠ent You start with the following equip⁠ment, in addition to the equi⁠pment⁠ granted by your background: ( a ) a mace or ( b ) a warhammer (if proficient) ( a ) scale mail, ( b ) leather armor, or ( c ) chain mail (if proficient) ( a ) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or ( b ) any simple weapon ( a ) a priest’s pack or ( b ) an explorer’s pack A shield and a holy symbol⁠ Spellcasting⁠ As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See chapter 4 for the general rules of spellcasting. Cant⁠rips At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cant⁠rips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Can⁠trips Known column of the Cleric table. Preparing and Casting Spells⁠ The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells⁠ equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells⁠ of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds , you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells⁠. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells⁠ requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting⁠ Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells⁠ comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one, as explained in chapter 4. Ritual Casting You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting⁠ Focus You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 3)⁠ as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. Divine Domain Choose one domain related to your deity: Life or War, both of which are detailed at the end of the class description. See the Player's Handbook for more domains. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and an additional benefit at 6th level. Domain Spells⁠ Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. Channel Divinity At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. Channel Divinity: Turn Undead As an action, you present your holy sym⁠bol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Destroy Undead Starting at 5th level, when an undead⁠ fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is 1/2 or lower. (Its challenge rating appears in its stat block.) Subclasses Life Domain War Domain",Essentials Kit,4415.0
4,Druid,"A Nature Priest of Primal Power Druids belong to ancient orders that call on the forces of nature. Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, and the four elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and wield elemental destruction. Revering nature above all, individual Druids gain their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both, and they typically unite with other Druids to perform rites that mark the passage of the seasons and other natural cycles. Druids are concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need for people to live in harmony with nature. Druids often guard sacred sites or watch over regions of unspoiled nature, but when a significant danger arises, Druids take a more active role as adventurers who combat the threat.

See "" Spells "" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class’s description. Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list . Druidcraft and Produce Flame are recommended. Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list . When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list , as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table . Spell Slots. The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest . Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list . Animal Friendship , Cure Wounds , Faerie Fire , and Thunderwave are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table . Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid , your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination. If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells. Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells . Level 1: Druidic You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids . While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have the Speak with Animals spell prepared. You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can’t decipher it without magic. Level 1: Primal Order You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice. Magician. You know one extra cantrip from the Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks . The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1). Warden. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor . Level 2: Wild Shape The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action , you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action . Number of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest , and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest . You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table . Known Forms. You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see "" Creature Stat Blocks "" for stat block options). The Rat , Riding Horse , Spider , and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form. When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed . When choosing known forms, you may look in the Monster Manual or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so. Beast Shapes Druid Level Known Forms Max CR Fly Speed 2 4 1/4 No 4 6 1/2 No 8 8 1 Yes Rules While Shape-Shifted. While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply: Temporary Hit Points. When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level. Game Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points ; Hit Point Dice ; Intelligence , Wisdom , and Charisma scores; class features ; languages ; and feats . You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature . If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block. No Spellcasting. You can’t cast spells, but shape- shifting doesn’t break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast. Objects. Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it’s practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you’re in that form. Level 2: Wild Companion You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you.

5,Fighter,"Questing knights, mighty champions, elite soldiers, and cunning mercenaries—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons⁠ and armor. And they are well acquainted with death, staring it defiantly in the face as they defend their friends and destroy their foes. Well-Rounded Specialists Every fighter can pick up a weapon and wield it ably. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants. Creating a Fighter As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character’s background: Where did you get your combat⁠ training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly brave? Did you get extra help from a mentor? What drove you to this training in the first place? Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics⁠, and military history. Or you might be self-taught. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you get your weapons and armor? They might have been heirlooms or military issue, or perhaps you scrimped and saved to buy them. Quick Build You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution. Second, choose the soldier background. The Fighter Level⁠ Proficiency Bonus Features 1st +2 Fighting Style, Second Wind 2nd +2 Action Surge (one use) 3rd +2 Martial Archetype 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 5th +3 Extra Attack 6th +3 Ability Score Improvement Class Features As a fighter, you gain the following class features. Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d10 per fighter level Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per fighter level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: All armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: None Saving Throws: Strength, Constitution Skills: Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, and Survival Equipment⁠ You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment⁠ granted by your background: ( a ) chain mail or ( b ) leather armor, longbow, and 20 arrows ( a ) a martial weapon and a shield or ( b ) two martial weapons ( a ) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or ( b ) two handaxes ( a ) a dungeoneer’s pack or ( b ) an explorer’s pack Fighting Style Choose one of these options as your specialty: Archery, Defense, Dueling, Great Weapon Fighting, Protection, or Two-Weapon Fighting. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Archery You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Great Weapon Fighting When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. Protection When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield⁠. Two-Weapon Fighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Second Wind You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Action Surge Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Martial Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat⁠ styles and techniques. The Champion and Eldritch Knight archetypes are detailed at the end of the class description; see the Player's Handbook for more information on martial archetypes. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level and again at 6th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Martial Archetypes Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.

6,Monk,"A Martial Artist of Supernatural Focus Monks use rigorous combat training and mental discipline to align themselves with the multiverse and focus their internal reservoirs of power. Different Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does. Monks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk’s hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery. Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline. Monks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.

Level 2: Monk’s Focus Your focus and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary energy within yourself. This energy is represented by Focus Points.

You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed below.

If you do so, choose a creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself if the attack was a melee attack or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn’t behind Total Cover if the attack was a ranged attack.

Level 6: Empowered Strikes Whenever you deal damage with your Unarmed Strike , it can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type. Level 7: Evasion When you’re subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. You don’t benefit from this feature if you have the Incapacitated condition. Level 9: Acrobatic Movement While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield , you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the movement.

7,Paladin,"A Devout Warrior of Sacred Oaths Paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of annihilation and corruption. Whether sworn before a god’s altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witnesses, a Paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion. Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect the helpless and those who fight at their side. Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world’s armies, but even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic.

You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a Long Rest . With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level. As a Bonus Action , you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature , up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool. You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature ; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature . Level 1: Spellcasting You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells , which appear in the Paladin spell list later in the class’s description. Spell Slots. The Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest . Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells. Heroism and Searing Smite are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Paladin spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Paladin , your list of prepared spells can include six Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination. If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells . Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells . Level 1: Weapon Mastery Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins . Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails . Level 2: Fighting Style You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see "" Feats ""). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below. Blessed Warrior. You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice (see the Cleric class’s section for a list of Cleric spells ). Guidance and Sacred Flame are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip . Level 2: Paladin’s Smite You always have the Divine Smite spell prepared. In addition, you can cast it without expending a spell slot, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again. Level 3: Channel Divinity You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create. You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest , and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest . You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11. If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature. Divine Sense. As a Bonus Action , you can open your awareness to detect Celestials , Fiends , and Undead . For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell. Level 3: Paladin Subclass You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. The Oath of Devotion , Oath of Glory , Oath of the Ancients , and Oath of Vengeance subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Paladin level or lower. Breaking Your Oath A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible. Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath. A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh. If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your DM. Your Paladin should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and adopt another one. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Extra Attack You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Level 5: Faithful Steed You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You always have the Find Steed spell prepared. You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest . Level 6: Aura of Protection You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot Emanation that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition. You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1). If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura while in them. Level 9: Abjure Foes As a Magic action , you can expend one use of this class’s Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature ) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target can do only one of the following on its turns: move, take an action , or take a Bonus Action . Level 10: Aura of Courage You and your allies have Immunity to the Frightened condition while in your Aura of Protection . If a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there. Level 11: Radiant Strikes Your strikes now carry supernatural power. When you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike , the target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage. Level 14: Restoring Touch When you use Lay On Hands on a creature , you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature : Blinded , Charmed , Deafened , Frightened , Paralyzed , or Stunned . You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On Hands for each of these conditions you remove; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature . Level 18: Aura Expansion Your Aura of Protection is now a 30-foot Emanation . Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Truesight is recommended. Paladin Spell List This section presents the Paladin spell list.

This section presents the Oath of Devotion, Oath of Glory, Oath of the Ancients, and Oath of Vengeance subclasses. Each of these subclasses represents a body of oaths that a Paladin begins taking upon joining the class. The final oath, taken at level 3, is the culmination of a Paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true Paladins until they’ve reached level 3 and made this oath. For others, the swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what was already in their hearts.

Many rogues focus on stealth⁠ and deception, while others refine ski⁠lls such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks. When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute stren⁠gth. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the at⁠tack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down. Creating a Rogue As you create your rogue character, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal⁠ past? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave your guild in sea⁠rch of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal? What led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Quick Build You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at Investigation. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction. Second, choose the criminal background.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per rogue level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per rogue level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light⁠ armor Weapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords Tools: Thieves’ tools Saving Throws: Dexterity, Intelligence Skills: Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth⁠ Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment⁠ granted by your background: ( a ) a rapier or ( b ) a shortsword ( a ) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or ( b ) a shortsword ( a ) a burglar’s pack, ( b ) a dungeoneer’s pack, or ( c ) an explorer’s pack Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools Expertise At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit. Sneak Attack Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the atta⁠ck roll. The atta⁠ck must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attac⁠k roll. The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. Thieves’ Cant During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message⁠ than it does to speak the same idea plainly. In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run. Cunning Action Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. Roguish Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities. The Arcane Trickster and Thief archetypes are detailed at the end of the class description. See the Player's Handbook for more archetype options. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Uncanny Dodge Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you. Roguish Archetypes Rogues steer their talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Thief Arcane Trickster",Essentials Kit,
10,Sorcerer,"A Dazzling Mage Filled with Innate Magic Sorcerers wield innate magic that is stamped into their being. Some Sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a baby’s birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer’s gift. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations. Sorcerers don’t learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source. Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn’t like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.

See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells , which appear in the Sorcerer spell list later in the class’s description. Cantrips. You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. Light , Prestidigitation , Shocking Grasp , and Sorcerous Burst are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice. When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table. Spell Slots. The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest . Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells . Burning Hands and Detect Magic are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer , your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination. If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells . Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells . Level 1: Innate Sorcery An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action , you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits: The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1. You have Advantage on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast. You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest . Level 2: Font of Magic You can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects. You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer Features table. You can’t have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest . You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points. Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points. You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot’s level (no action required). Creating Spell Slots. As a Bonus Action , you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest . Creating Spell Slots Spell Slot Level Sorcery Point Cost Min. Sorcerer Level 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 5 5 4 6 7 5 7 9 Level 2: Metamagic Because your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from “ Meta­magic Options ” later in this class’s description. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17. Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. The Aberrant Sorcery , Clockwork Sorcery , Draconic Sorcery , and Wild Magic Sorcery subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Sorcerer level or lower. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration When you finish a Short Rest , you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest . Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it. In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your Metamagic options on each spell you cast. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended. Level 20: Arcane Apotheosis While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use one Metamagic option on each of your turns without spending Sorcery Points on it. Metamagic Options The following options are available to your Meta­magic feature . The options are presented in alphabetical order. Careful Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, spend 1 Sorcery Point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature ). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and it takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save. Distant Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5 feet, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double the spell’s range. Or when you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to make the spell’s range 30 feet. Empowered Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), and you must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. Extended Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours. If the affected spell requires Concentration , you have Advantage on any saving throw you make to maintain that Concentration . Heightened Spell Cost: 2 Sorcery Points When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to give one target of the spell Disadvantage on saves against the spell. Quickened Spell Cost: 2 Sorcery Points When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting. You can’t modify a spell in this way if you’ve already cast a level 1+ spell on the current turn, nor can you cast a level 1+ spell on this turn after modifying a spell in this way. Seeking Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll. You can use Seeking Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. Subtle Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to cast it without any Verbal, Somatic, or Material components, except Material components that are consumed by the spell or that have a cost specified in the spell. Transmuted Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: Acid , Cold , Fire , Lightning , Poison , Thunder . Twinned Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell, such as Charm Person , that can be cast with a higher-level spell slot to target an additional creature , you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to increase the spell’s effective level by 1. Sorcerer Spell List This section presents the Sorcerer spell list . The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed.

11,Warlock,"An Occultist Empowered by Otherworldly Pacts Warlocks quest for knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of extraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power. Warlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them. Once a pact is made, a Warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater power and deeper knowledge, which typically means some kind of adventure.

You gain one invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. Invocations are described in the “ Eldritch Invocation Options ” section later in this class’s description. Prerequisites. If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock , you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5. Replacing and Gaining Invocations. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have. When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table . You can’t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise. Level 1: Pact Magic Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells , which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class’s description. Cantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice. When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table . Spell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest . For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock , you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Witch Bolt , you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell. Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells . Charm Person and Hex are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table . Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell , which can be of levels 1–3. If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level. Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells . Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells . Level 2: Magical Cunning You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest . Level 3: Warlock Subclass You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The Archfey Patron , Celestial Patron , Fiend Patron , and Great Old One Patron subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Warlock level or lower. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 9: Contact Patron In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s saving throw . Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest . Level 11: Mystic Arcanum Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again. As shown in the Warlock Features table , you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 ( level 7 spell ), 15 ( level 8 spell ), and 17 ( level 9 spell ). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a Long Rest . Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended. Level 20: Eldritch Master When you use your Magical Cunning feature , you regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots. Eldritch Invocation Options Eldritch Invocation options appear in alphabetical order. Agonizing Blast Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals Damage Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that deals damage.

Devil’s Sight Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock You can see normally in Dim Light and Darkness —both magical and nonmagical—within 120 feet of yourself.

Eldritch Spear Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals Damage Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that deals damage and has a range of 10+ feet.

Each time you do so, choose a different eligible cantrip . Fiendish Vigor Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock You can cast False Life on yourself without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell with this feature, you don’t roll the die for the Temporary Hit Points ; you automatically get the highest number on the die. Gaze of Two Minds Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock You can use a Bonus Action to touch a willing creature and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can take a Bonus Action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. The connection ends if you don’t maintain it in this way. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature , and you can cast spells as if you were in your space or the other creature’s space if the two of you are within 60 feet of each other. Gift of the Depths Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock You can breathe underwater, and you gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed . You can also cast Water Breathing once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way again when you finish a Long Rest . Gift of the Protectors Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, Pact of the Tome Invocation A new page appears in your Book of Shadows when you conjure it. With your permission, a creature can take an action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one name). When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 Hit Point instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a Long Rest . As a Magic action , you can erase a name on the page by touching it. Investment of the Chain Master Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Chain Invocation When you cast Find Familiar , you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits. Aerial or Aquatic. The familiar gains either a Fly Speed or a Swim Speed (your choice) of 40 feet. Quick Attack. As a Bonus Action , you can command the familiar to take the Attack action . Necrotic or Radiant Damage. Whenever the familiar deals Bludgeoning , Piercing , or Slashing damage , you can make it deal Necrotic or Radiant damage instead. Your Save DC. If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC. Resistance. When the familiar takes damage, you can take a Reaction to grant it Resistance against that damage. Lessons of the First Ones Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock You have received knowledge from an elder entity of the multiverse, allowing you to gain one Origin feat of your choice (see chapter 5 ). Repeatable. You can gain this invocation more than once. Each time you do so, choose a different Origin feat . Lifedrinker Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade Invocation Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can deal an extra 1d6 Necrotic , Psychic , or Radiant damage (your choice) to the creature , and you can expend one of your Hit Point Dice to roll it and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point ).

Pact of the Blade As a Bonus Action , you can conjure a pact weapon in your hand—a Simple or Martial Melee weapon of your choice with which you bond—or create a bond with a magic weapon you touch; you can’t bond with a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or another Warlock is bonded with it. Until the bond ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus . Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity ; and you can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic , Psychic , or Radiant damage or its normal damage type . Your bond with the weapon ends if you use this feature’s Bonus Action again, if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the bond ends. Pact of the Chain You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a Magic action without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: Imp , Pseudodragon , Quasit , Skeleton , Slaad Tadpole , Sphinx of Wonder , Sprite , or Venomous Snake (see appendix B for the familiar’s stat block). Additionally, when you take the Attack action , you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its Reaction . Pact of the Tome Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure forth a book in your hand at the end of a Short or Long Rest . This Book of Shadows (you determine its appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you can access, granting you the benefits below. The book disappears if you conjure another book with this feature or if you die. Cantrips and Rituals. When the book appears, choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells that have the Ritual tag. The spells can be from any class’s spell list, and they must be spells you don’t already have prepared. While the book is on your person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and they function as Warlock spells for you. Spellcasting Focus. You can use the book as a Spellcasting Focus . Repelling Blast Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals Damage via an Attack Roll Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that requires an attack roll . When you hit a Large or smaller creature with that cantrip, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from you. Repeatable. You can gain this invocation more than once. Each time you do so, choose a different eligible cantrip . Thirsting Blade Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade Invocation You gain the Extra Attack feature for your pact weapon only.

12,Wizard,"Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells⁠ of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Scholars of the Arcane Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study. Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells⁠ as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic. The Lure of Knowledge Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library⁠ or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age. Creating a Wizard How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic? What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the face of danger. Quick Build You can make a wizard quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the sage background. Third, choose the light , mage hand , and ray of frost cantrips, along with the following 1st-level spells for your spellbook: burning hands , charm person , mage armor , magic missile , shield, and sleep . The Wizard Level Proficiency Bonus Features Cantrips Known Spell Leve⁠l Slots: 1st Spell Leve⁠l Slots: 2nd Spell Leve⁠l Slots: 3rd Spell Leve⁠l Slots: 4th Spell Le⁠vel Slots: 5th Spell Le⁠vel Slots: 6th Spell Le⁠vel Slots: 7th Spell L⁠evel Slots: 8th Spell Lev⁠el Slots: 9th 1st +2 Spellcasting, Arcane Recovery 3 2 — — — — — — — — 2nd +2 Arcane Tradition 3 3 — — — — — — — — 3rd +2 — 3 4 2 — — — — — — — 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 — — — — — — — 5th +3 — 4 4 3 2 — — — — — — 6th +3 Arcane Tradition feature 4 4 3 3 — — — — — — Class Features As a wizard, you gain the following class features. Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d6 per wizard level Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: None Weapons: Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows Tools: None Saving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom Skills: Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment⁠ granted by your background: ( a ) a quarterstaff or ( b ) a dagger ( a ) a component pouch or ( b ) an arcane focus ( a ) a scholar’s pack or ( b ) an explorer’s pack A spellbook Spellcasting As a student of arcane magic⁠, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 4 for the general rules of spellcasting. Cantrips At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. Spellbook At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook⁠ is the repository of the wizard spells⁠ you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind. Preparing and Casting Spells The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells⁠ from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells⁠ of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile , you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells⁠. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells⁠ requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells⁠ through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one, as explained in chapter 4. Your Spellbook⁠ The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells⁠ during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library⁠. Copying a Spell into the Book⁠. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook⁠ using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. Replacing the Book⁠. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook⁠. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook⁠, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook⁠. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells⁠ to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book’s Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library⁠, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook⁠. Ritual Casting You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook”). Arcane Recovery You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. Arcane Tradition When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic: Evocation, or Transmutation, both of which are detailed at the end of the class description. See the Player's Handbook for more information on arcane traditions. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Arcane Traditions The most ancient arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools, as described in chapter 4. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. Elsewhere, they are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students. School of Evocation School of Transmutation",Essentials Kit,4415.0
