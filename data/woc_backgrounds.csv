name,description
Acolyte,"You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power. Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed or those specified by your DM, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood⁠ to assist the prie⁠sts in the sacred rites? Or were you a high prie⁠st who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: A holy symbol⁠ (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp Feature: Shelter of the Faithful As an acolyte, you command⁠ the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle. You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple. Suggested Characteristics d8 Personality Trait 1 I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person’s deeds and example. 2 I can find common⁠ ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace. 3 I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen. 4 Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude. 5 I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation. 6 I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods. 7 I’ve enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple’s elite. Rough living grates on me. 8 I’ve spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world. d6 Ideal 1 Tradition. The ancient traditions of worship and sacrifice must be preserved and upheld. (Lawful) 2 Charity. I always try to help those in need, no matter what the personal cost. (Good) 3 Change. We must help bring about the changes the gods are constantly working in the world. (Chaotic) 4 Power. I hope to one day rise to the top of my faith’s religious hierarchy. (Lawful) 5 Faith. I trust that my deity will guide my actions. I have faith that if I work hard, things will go well. (Lawful) 6 Aspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of my god’s favor by matching my actions against his or her teachings. (Any) d6 Bond 1 I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago. 2 I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me a heretic. 3 I owe my life to the prie⁠st who took me in when my parents died. 4 Everything I do is for the comm⁠on people. 5 I will do anything to protect the temple where I served. 6 I seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies consider heretical and seek to destroy. d6 Flaw 1 I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely. 2 I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple’s hierarchy. 3 My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god. 4 I am inflexible in my thinking. 5 I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them. 6 Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life."
Anthropologist,"You have always been fascinated by other cultures, from the most ancient and primeval lost lands to the most modern civilizations. By studying other cultures' customs, philosophies, laws, rituals, religious beliefs, languages, and art, you have learned how tribes, empires, and all forms of society in between craft their own destinies and doom. This knowledge came to you not only through first-hand observation-by visiting far-flung settlements and exploring local histories and customs. Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion Languages: Two of your choice. Equipment: A leather-bound diary, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, a set of traveler's clothes, one trinket of special significance, and a pouch containing 10 gp. Cultural Chameleon Before becoming an adventurer, you spent much of your adult life away from your homeland, living among people different from your kin. You came to understand these foreign cultures and the ways of their people, who eventually treated you as one of their own. One culture had more of an influence on you than any other, shaping your beliefs and customs. Choose a race whose culture you've adopted, or roll on the Adopted Culture table. Adopted Culture d8 Culture 1 Aarakocra 2 Dwarf 3 Elf 4 Goblin 5 Halfling 6 Human 7 Lizardfolk 8 Orc Feature: Adept Linguist You can communicate with humanoids who don't speak any language you know. You must observe the humanoids interacting with one another for at least 1 day, after which you learn a handful of impotant words, expressions, and gestures- enough to communicate on a rudimentary level. Suggested Characteristics Anthropologists leave behind the societies into which they were born to discover what life is like in other parts of the world. They seek to see how other races and civilizations survive- or why they did not. Some anthropologists are driven by intellectual curiosity, while others want the fame and recognition that comes with being the first to discover a new people, a lost tribe, or the truth about an ancient empire's downfall. d6 Personality Trait 1 I prefer the company of those who aren't like me, including people of other races. 2 I'm a stickler when it comes to observing proper etiguette and local customs. 3 I would rather observe than meddle. 4 By living among violent people, I have become desensitized to violence. 5 I would risk life and limb to discover a new culture or unravel the secrets of a dead one. 6 When I arrive at a new settlement for the first time, I must learn all its customs. d6 Ideal 1 Discovery. I want to be the first person to discover a lost culture. (Any) 2 Distance. One must not interfere with the affairs of another culture-even one in need of aid. (Lawful) 3 Knowledge. By understanding other races and cultures, we learn to understand ourselves. (Any) 4 Power. Common people crave strong leadership, and I do my utmost to provide it. (Lawful) 5 Protection. I must do everything possible to save a society facing extinction. (Good) 6 Indifferent. Life is cruel. What's the point in saving people if they're going to die anyway? (Chaotic) d6 Bond 1 My mentor gave me a journal filled with lore and wisdom. Losing it would devastate me. 2 Having lived among the people of a primeval tribe or clan, I long to return and se how they are faring. 3 Years ago, tragedy struck the members of an isolated society I befrended, and I will honor them. 4 I want to learn more about a particular humanoid culture that fascinates me. 5 I seek to avenge a clan, tribe, kingdom, or empire that was wiped out. 6 I have a trinket that I believe is the key to finding a long-lost society. d6 Flaw 1 Boats make me seasick. 2 I talk to myself, and I don't make friends easily. 3 I believe that I'm intellectually superior to people from other cultures and have much to teach them. 4 I've picked up some unpleasant habits living among goblins, lizardfolk, or orcs. 5 I complain about everything. 6 I wear a tribal mask and never take it off."
Archaeologist,"An archaeologist learns about the long-lost and fallen cultures of the past by studying their remains—their bones, their ruins, their surviving masterworks, and their tombs. Those who practice archaeology travel to the far corners of the world to root through crumbled cities and lost dungeons, digging in search of artifacts that might tell the stories of monarchs and high priests, wars and cataclysms. Skill Proficiencies: History, Survival Tool Proficiencies: Cartographer's tools or navigator's tools Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A wooden case containing a map to a ruin or dungeon, a bullseye lantern, a miner's pick, a set of traveler's clothes, a shovel, a two-person tent, a trinket recovered from a dig site, and a pouch containing 25 gp Dust Digger Prior to becoming an adventurer, you spent most of your young life crawling around in the dust, pilfering relics of questionable value from crypts and ruins. Though you managed to sell a few of your discoveries and earn enough coin to buy proper adventuring gear, you have held onto an item that has great emotional value to you. Roll on the Signature Item table to see what you have, or choose an item from the table. Signature Item d8 Item 1 10-foot pole 2 Crowbar 3 Hat 4 Hooded lantern 5 Medallion 6 Shovel 7 Sledgehammer 8 Whip Feature: Historical Knowledge When you enter a ruin or dungeon, you can correctly ascertain its original purpose and determine its builders, whether those were dwarves, elves, humans, yuan-ti, or some other known race. In addition, you can determine the monetary value of art objects more than a century old. Suggested Characteristics Few archaeologists can resist the lure of an unexplored ruin or dungeon, particularly if such a site is the source of legends or is rumored to contain the treasures and relics of wizards, warlords, or royalty. Some archaeologists plunder for wealth or fame, while others consider it their calling to illuminate the past or keep the world's greatest treasures from falling into the wrong hands. Whatever their motivations, archaeologists combine the qualities of a scrappy historian with the self-made heroism of treasure-hunting scoundrel. d8 Trait 1 I love a good puzzle or mystery. 2 I'm a pack rat who never throws anything away. 3 Fame is more important to me than money. 4 I have no qualms about stealing from the dead. 5 I'm happier in a dusty old tomb than I am in the centers of civillization. 6 Traps don't make me nervous. Idiots who trigger traps make me nervous. 7 I might fail, but I will never give up. 8 You might think I'm a scholar, but I love a good brawl. These fists were made for punching. d6 Ideal 1 Preservation. That artifact belongs in a museum. (Good) 2 Greed. I won't risk my life for nothing. I expect some kind of payment. (Any) 3 Death Wish. Nothing is more exhilarating than a narrow escape from the jaws of death. (Chaotic) 4 Dignity. The dead and their belongings deserve to be treated with respect. (Lawful) 5 Immortality. All my exploring is part of a plan to find the secret of everlasting life. (Any) 6 Danger. With every great discovery comes grave danger. The two walk hand in hand. (Any) d6 Bond 1 Ever since I was a child, I've heard stories about a lost city. I aim to find it, learn its secrets, and earn my place in the history books. 2 I want to find my mentor, who disappeared on an expedition some time ago. 3 I have a friendly rival. Only one of us can be the best, and I aim to prove it's me. 4 I won't sell an art object or other treasure that has historical significance or is one of a kind. 5 I'm secretly in love with the wealthy patron who sponsors my archaeological exploits. 6 I hope to bring prestige to a library, a museum, or a university. d6 Flaw 1 I have a secret fear of some common wild animal—and in my work, I see them everywhere. 2 I can't leave a room without searching it for secret doors. 3 When I'm not exploring dungeons or ruins, I get jittery and impatient. 4 I have no time for friends or family. I spend every waking moment thinking about and preparing for my next epedition. 5 When given the choice of going left or right, I always go left. 6 I can't sleep except in total darkness."
Artisan,"Ability Scores Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence Feat Crafter Skill Proficiencies Investigation and Persuasion Tool Proficiency Choose one kind of Artisan’s Tools Equipment Choose A or B: (A) Artisan’s Tools (same as above), 2 Pouches, Traveler’s Clothes, 32 GP; or (B) 50 GP You began mopping floors and scrubbing counters in an artisan’s workshop for a few coppers per day as soon as you were strong enough to carry a bucket. When you were old enough to apprentice, you learned to create basic crafts of your own, as well as how to sweet-talk the occasional demanding customer. Your trade has also given you a keen eye for detail."
Astral Drifter,"For longer than you can remember, you have traversed the Astral Sea. There, you experienced firsthand the wonders of the Silver Void: you stopped aging and no longer felt hunger or thirst. Driven by wanderlust, you drifted from one part of the Astral Sea to another, like a mote of dust on the wind. You have lost count of the decades that have passed since you arrived here. In your travels, you have camped on the petrified hulks of dead gods and narrowly escaped the psychic winds that sweep across the Astral Sea while also avoiding prolonged contact with the plane’s most dangerous denizens. Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion Languages: Two of your choice (Celestial or Gith recommended) Equipment: A set of traveler’s clothes, a diary, an ink pen, a bottle of ink, and a pouch containing 10 gp Longevity You are 20d6 years older than you look, because you have spent that much time in the Astral Sea without aging. Feature: Divine Contact You gain the Magic Initiate feat from the Player’s Handbook and must choose cleric for the feat. In the Astral Sea, you crossed paths with a wandering deity. The encounter was brief and nonviolent, yet it made a lasting impression on you. This deity saw fit to share one secret or obscure bit of cosmic lore with you. Work with your DM to determine the details of this knowledge and its impact on the campaign. Roll on the Divine Contact table to determine which deity you encountered, or work with your DM to identify a more suitable choice. Divine Contact d10 Wandering Deity 1 Corellon, god of art and magic 2 Tymora, god of good fortune 3 Fharlanghn, god of horizons and travel 4 Istus, god of fate and destiny 5 Nuada, god of war and warriors 6 Zivilyn, god of wisdom 7 Arawn, god of life and death 8 Hecate, god of magic and moons 9 Celestian, god of stars and wanderers 10 Ptah, god of knowledge and secrets"
Athlete,"Athlete You strive to perfect yourself physically and in execution of everything you do. The thrill of competition lights fire in your blood, and the roar of the crowd drives you forward. Tales of your exploits precede you and might open doors or loosen tongues. Whether in one of the poleis, between them, or among the nonhuman peoples of Theros, physical contests and those who pursue them command respect bordering on reverence. Athletes arise from all walks of life and all cultures and quite often cross paths with one another. Skill Proficiencies: Acrobatics, Athletics Languages: One of your choice Tool Proficiencies: Vehicles (land) Equipment: A bronze discus or leather ball, a lucky charm or past trophy, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp Favored Event While many athletes practice various games and events, most excel at a single form of competition. Roll or choose from the options in the Favored Event table to determine the athletic event in which you excel. Favored Event d8 Favored Event 1 Marathon 2 Long-distance running 3 Wrestling 4 Boxing 5 Chariot or horse race 6 Pankration (mixed unarmed combat) 7 Hoplite race (racing in full armor with a unit) 8 Pentathlon (running, long jump, discus, javelin, wrestling) Feature: Echoes of Victory You have attracted admiration among spectators, fellow athletes, and trainers in the region that hosted your past athletic victories. When visiting any settlement within 100 miles of where you grew up, there is a 50 percent chance you can find someone there who admires you and is willing to provide information or temporary shelter. Between adventures, you might compete in athletic events sufficient enough to maintain a comfortable lifestyle, as per the ""Practicing a Profession"" downtime activity in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook . Suggested Characteristics Competition can forge strong bonds between teammates and rivals or ignite bitter feuds that burn outside the arena. Athletes often apply lessons from their training to their lives in general. Athlete Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I feel most at peace during physical exertion, be it exercise or battle. 2 I don’t like to sit idle. 3 I have a daily exercise routine that I refuse to break. 4 Obstacles exist to be overcome. 5 When I see others struggling, I offer to help. 6 I love to trade banter and gibes. 7 Anything worth doing is worth doing best. 8 I get irritated if people praise someone else and not me. Athlete Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Competition. I strive to test myself in all things. (Chaotic) 2 Triumph. The best part of winning is seeing my rivals brought low. (Evil) 3 Camaraderie. The strongest bonds are forged through struggle. (Good) 4 People. I strive to inspire my spectators. (Neutral) 5 Tradition. Every game has rules, and the playing field must be level. (Lawful) 6 Growth. Lessons hide in victory and defeat. (Any) Athlete Bonds d6 Bond 1 My teammates are my family. 2 I will overcome a rival and prove myself their better. 3 My mistake got someone hurt. I’ll never make that mistake again. 4 I will be the best for the honor and glory of my home. 5 The person who trained me is the most important person in my world. 6 I strive to live up to a specific hero’s example. Athlete Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I indulge in a habit that threatens my reputation or my health. 2 I’ll do absolutely anything to win. 3 I ignore anyone who doesn’t compete and anyone who loses to me. 4 I have lingering pain from old injuries. 5 Any defeat or failure on my part is because my opponent cheated. 6 I must be the captain of any group I join."
Azorius Functionary,"The brutes are at the gate, chaos is looming, and the only thing standing in the way of disaster is the foundation of law and order—as embodied in the Azorius Senate . You’re a proud member of the Azorius guild , which both enacts and enforces the laws that make Ravnican society function smoothly and safely. Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Intimidation Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: An Azorius insignia, a scroll containing the text of a law important to you, a bottle of blue ink, a pen, a set of fine clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp (Azorius-minted 1-zino coins) Feature: Legal Authority You have the authority to enforce the laws of Ravnica, and that status inspires a certain amount of respect and even fear in the populace. People mind their manners in your presence and avoid drawing your attention; they assume you have the right to be wherever you are. Showing your Azorius insignia gets you an audience with anyone you want to talk to (though it might cause more problems than it solves when you’re dealing with incorrigible lawbreakers). If you abuse this privilege, though, you can get in serious trouble with your superiors and even be stripped of your position. Azorius Guild Spells Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature For you, the spells on the Azorius Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.) Azorius Guild Spells Spell Level Spells Cantrip friends , message 1st command , ensnaring strike 2nd arcane lock , calm emotions , hold person 3rd clairvoyance , counterspell 4th compulsion , divination 5th dominate person Your magic often takes the form of blue or golden runes floating and glowing in the air in circular patterns or of shimmering azure barriers of magical energy. If you cast ensnaring strike, for example, the vines created by the spell might appear as rune-inscribed glowing bands that wrap around the target and hold it in place. Suggested Characteristics Members of the Azorius Senate tend toward a demeanor of cold dignity and a pragmatic, orderly nature. Steeped in the law as they are, their ideals and priorities revolve around legal issues. Personality Traits d8 Trait 1 I try never to let my judgment become clouded by emotion. 2 I have infinite patience with the dolts and boors I’m forced to deal with every day. 3 When I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed. 4 I just want things the way I like them: neat, orderly, and clean. 5 No wrongdoing can escape my watchful gaze. 6 I always say exactly what I mean, no matter how many words it takes to communicate the particular nuance I am attempting to convey. 7 I’m very literal and don’t appreciate metaphor or sarcasm. 8 I never change my mind once it’s made up. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any) 2 Order. The law is meant to ensure that the gears of society turn smoothly and quietly. (Lawful) 3 Peace. The ultimate object of the law is to remove violence from society. (Good) 4 Compliance. Coercion is a fine way of ensuring that the laws are obeyed. (Lawful) 5 Legislation. The law embodies excellence in its precision and detail. (Lawful) 6 Punishment. A public display of consequences is an excellent deterrent for other criminals. (Evil) Bonds d6 Bond 1 I am beholden to an Azorius arrester who captured the criminal who killed my parents, saving me from the same fate. 2 I hope one day to write the laws, not just enforce them. 3 I tried and failed to prevent a murder, and I have sworn to find and arrest the perpetrator. 4 I successfully prevented a murder, and the would-be perpetrator wants me dead. 5 One of my parents was prominent in the guild, and I resent constantly being compared to that standard. 6 I’ve modeled my career after a highly respected lawmage or arrester, but I fear that my role model might be involved in something illegal. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I’m unable to distinguish between the letter and the spirit of the law. 2 I seem like a harsh judge to others, but I judge myself most harshly of all. 3 I have a secret, illegal vice. 4 I was traumatized by witnessing a crime as a child. 5 I’m incapable of deception. 6 I wish I had joined the Boros , but I fear they’d never accept me."
Boros Legionnaire,"As a member of the Boros Legion , your life is devoted to the service of angels and consecrated to the work of establishing justice and peace on the streets of Ravnica. You might be a true believer, inspired by the example of the angels, moved by the plight of the downtrodden, and devoted to the cause of justice. Or you could be a cynic in the ranks, perhaps because you reluctantly followed in the footsteps of a Boros parent, succumbed to the persuasion of a charismatic recruiter’s lofty promises, or were drawn in by the prospect of a life of action. Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Intimidation Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set Languages: Choose one of Celestial, Draconic, Goblin, or Minotaur Equipment: A Boros insignia, a feather from an angel’s wing, a tattered piece of a Boros banner (a souvenir from a famous battle), a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 2 gp ( Boros -minted 1-zino coins) Feature: Legion Station You have an established place in the hierarchy of the Boros Legion . You can requisition simple equipment for temporary use, and you can gain access to any Boros garrison in Ravnica, where you can rest in safety and receive the attention of medics. You are also paid a salary of 1 gp (a Boros -minted 1-zino coin) per week, which (combined with free lodging in your garrison) enables you to maintain a poor lifestyle between adventures. Boros Guild Spells Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature For you, the spells on the Boros Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.) Boros Guild Spells Spell Level Spells Cantrip fire bolt , sacred flame 1st guiding bolt , heroism 2nd aid , scorching ray 3rd beacon of hope , blinding smite 4th death ward , wall of fire 5th flame strike Your magic often features dramatic bursts of flame or radiance. When you cast beneficial spells on your allies, they appear momentarily surrounded with halos of bright fire. Suggested Characteristics The Boros Legion is a zealous army, full of righteous energy tempered with military discipline. Its members share its leadership’s devotion to the ideals of justice, or they find satisfaction in the more warfare-oriented aspects of the legion’s work. Personality Traits d8 Personality Traits 1 I approach every task with the same high degree of military precision. 2 I am always the first into the fray. 3 I bear any injury or indignity with stoic discipline. 4 My righteous wrath is easily inflamed by the slightest iniquity. 5 My honor is more important to me than my life. 6 Dangerous work is best accomplished by an orderly group working with common purpose. 7 I treat my weapons, uniform, and insignia with reverence, for they are gifts from the angels. 8 I pace when standing and fidget incessantly when forced to sit. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any) 2 Justice. Achieving justice requires establishing fair, equitable, and compassionate relationships within a community. (Good) 3 Protection. It isn’t right for innocents to suffer because of the arrogance of the powerful. (Good) 4 Solidarity. It is most crucial to act with a single will, marching side by side in perfect accord. (Lawful) 5 Order. Society functions only if people do their duty and respect the chain of command. (Lawful) 6 Conviction. Anything worth doing is worth doing with your whole heart. (Lawful) Bonds d6 Bond 1 I would lay down my life for Aurelia and the angels. 2 I owe my life to the Boros captain who took me in when I was living on the streets. 3 My fellow legionnaires are my family. 4 I wield the same Boros weapon my grandparent did, for the honor of our family. 5 I ran with the Rakdos in my youth, and I’m striving to atone for my past misdeeds. 6 I do what I can to help out the spouse of a comrade who died in battle. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I act bravely when I’m in a group, but I’m a coward when I’m alone. 2 I see everything in clear-cut black and white. 3 I’m just a little fascinated by the ways of the Gruul . 4 I trust the chain of command more than anything—more even than my closest friends. 5 I’m slow to trust members of other guilds. 6 I’ve been known to turn a blind eye to injustice, with the help of a modest bribe."
Celebrity Adventurer's Scion,"Your family name strikes fear and admiration in the hearts of the common folk—but that’s got nothing to do with you. Songs and stories celebrating the adventuring exploits of your famous parent are widely known. Kids across the land grew up wishing they were you. But being the child of a famous adventurer wasn’t all hugs and kisses. You seldom saw your celebrity-adventurer parent, and when they were around, it was all about them and tales of slaying this demon or vanquishing that dragon. All too often, you’d be woken out of a sound sleep by someone standing outside your home screaming about the latest threat to the town, the region, or the world. In the end, all you have to show for your lineage is your name. Most of the family’s money went for consumables, from potions of healing and spell scrolls to copious amounts of dwarven ale. And everyone expects you to swing a sword or sling spells like your famous forebear, making it doubly hard for you to prove yourself. Skill Proficiency: Perception, Performance Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: Disguise kit, a set of fine clothes, and a belt pouch containing 30 gp Feature: Name Dropping You know and have met any number of powerful people across the land—and some of them might even remember you. You might be able to wrangle minor assistance from a major figure in the campaign, at the DM’s discretion. Additionally, the common folk treat you with deference, and your heritage and the stories you tell might be good for a free meal or a place to sleep. Suggested Characteristics Scions of celebrity adventurers must deal with fame that’s not theirs, wealth they didn’t earn, and expectations they can never hope to meet. These hardships can have adverse effects, but those who cope with them can arrive at a decent attitude and a grounded worldview. Those who fail become bitter—or worse. d8 Personality Trait 1 I will never get out of my famous parent’s shadow, and no one else will ever understand this burden. 2 I’ve seen enough of the adventuring life to have realistic expectations and empathy for my peers. 3 Living up to my legacy will be difficult, but I’m going to do it. 4 I’m used to the very best in life, and that’s a hard habit to break. 5 My parent taught me a sense of duty. I strive to uphold it, even when the odds are against me. 6 No one can fake a smile, a handshake, or an interested nod like I can. 7 I’ve been part of the adventuring life since I was old enough to walk. Let me explain a few things to you. 8 No risk is too great for the rewards of defeating my enemies … and taking their stuff. d6 Ideal 1 Power. The only way to get ahead in this world is to attain power and hold onto it with all your might. (Evil) 2 Peace. Those who can find or make peace in the chaotic world around them have everything. (Lawful) 3 Fame. I’ve seen what fame can bring. And I’ll do anything to get all that for myself. (Neutral) 4 Training. Hard work, sacrifice, and training lead to success—and eventually to perfection. (Any) 5 Anonymity. I want to be successful. And alone. With lots of guards and wards between me and everyone else in the world. (Any) 6 Wisdom. Material wealth is an illusion. Wisdom is the real treasure. (Good) d6 Bond 1 While my parent was out adventuring, a servant raised me, and I care about that person more than anyone. 2 I consider every member of my parent’s former adventuring party to be family. 3 Despite their absences, my famous parent was kind and generous. I love them and want to make them proud. 4 My parent once brought a cursed magic item home. It is my obsession. 5 My childhood home holds all my best memories, and its upkeep is my primary concern. 6 Growing up, I had an imaginary friend I could always count on. That friend is still with me. d6 Flaw 1 You don’t know what I’m going through. You never can. 2 You. Fetch my cloak. And maybe rub my feet for a while. 3 My comrades are brave, but I must defeat this threat alone to prove my worth. 4 Oh, yeah, that spell? Named after my parent’s best friend. Let me tell you about them. 5 My best days are behind me. Ahead lies only toil, pain, and death. 6 You have to look out for yourself. No one else will."
Charlatan,"Ability Scores Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma Feat Skilled Skill Proficiencies Deception and Sleight of Hand Tool Proficiency Forgery Kit Equipment Choose A or B: (A) Forgery Kit, Costume, Fine Clothes, 15 GP; or (B) 50 GP Once you were old enough to order an ale, you soon had a favorite stool in every tavern within ten miles of where you were born. As you traveled the circuit from public house to watering hole, you learned to prey on unfortunates who were in the market for a comforting lie or two—perhaps a sham potion or forged ancestry records."
City Watch,"You have served the community where you grew up, standing as its first line of defense against crime. You aren’t a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible enemies. Instead, your service to your hometown was to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe. You might have been part of the City Watch of Waterdeep, the baton-wielding police force of the City of Splendors, protecting the common folk from thieves and rowdy nobility alike. Or you might have been one of the valiant defenders of Silverymoon, a member of the Silverwatch or even one of the magic-wielding Spellguard. Perhaps you hail from Neverwinter and have served as one of its Wintershield watchmen, the newly founded branch of guards who vow to keep safe the City of Skilled Hands. Even if you’re not city-born or city-bred, this background can describe your early years as a member of law enforcement. Most settlements of any size have their own constables and police forces, and even smaller communities have sheriffs and bailiffs who stand ready to protect their community. Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Insight Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: A uniform in the style of your unit and indicative of your rank, a horn with which to summon help, a set of manacles, and a pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Watcher’s Eye Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you’re more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter. Variant: Investigator Rarer than watch or patrol members are a community’s investigators, who are responsible for solving crimes after the fact. Though such folk are seldom found in rural areas, nearly every settlement of decent size has at least one or two watch members who have the skill to investigate crime scenes and track down criminals. If your prior experience is as an investigator, you have proficiency in Investigation rather than Athletics. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of the city watch. Your bond is likely associated with your fellow watch members or the watch organization itself and almost certainly concerns your community. Your ideal probably involves the fostering of peace and safety. An investigator is likely to have an ideal connected to achieving justice by successfully solving crimes."
City Watch Investigator,"You have served the community where you grew up, standing as its first line of defense against crime. You aren’t a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible enemies. Instead, your service to your hometown was to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe. You might have been part of the City Watch of Waterdeep, the baton-wielding police force of the City of Splendors, protecting the common folk from thieves and rowdy nobility alike. Or you might have been one of the valiant defenders of Silverymoon, a member of the Silverwatch or even one of the magic-wielding Spellguard. Perhaps you hail from Neverwinter and have served as one of its Wintershield watchmen, the newly founded branch of guards who vow to keep safe the City of Skilled Hands. Even if you’re not city-born or city-bred, this background can describe your early years as a member of law enforcement. Most settlements of any size have their own constables and police forces, and even smaller communities have sheriffs and bailiffs who stand ready to protect their community. Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Insight Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: A uniform in the style of your unit and indicative of your rank, a horn with which to summon help, a set of manacles, and a pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Watcher’s Eye Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you’re more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter. Variant: Investigator Rarer than watch or patrol members are a community’s investigators, who are responsible for solving crimes after the fact. Though such folk are seldom found in rural areas, nearly every settlement of decent size has at least one or two watch members who have the skill to investigate crime scenes and track down criminals. If your prior experience is as an investigator, you have proficiency in Investigation rather than Athletics. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of the city watch. Your bond is likely associated with your fellow watch members or the watch organization itself and almost certainly concerns your community. Your ideal probably involves the fostering of peace and safety. An investigator is likely to have an ideal connected to achieving justice by successfully solving crimes."
Clan Crafter,"The Stout Folk are well known for their artisanship and the worth of their handiworks, and you have been trained in that ancient tradition. For years you labored under a dwarf master of the craft, enduring long hours and dismissive, sour-tempered treatment in order to gain the fine skills you possess today. You are most likely a dwarf, but not necessarily—particularly in the North, the shield dwarf clans learned long ago that only proud fools who are more concerned for their egos than their craft turn away promising apprentices, even those of other races. If you aren’t a dwarf, however, you have taken a solemn oath never to take on an apprentice in the craft: it is not for non-dwarves to pass on the skills of Moradin’s favored children. You would have no difficulty, however, finding a dwarf master who was willing to receive potential apprentices who came with your recommendation. Skill Proficiencies: History, Insight Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools Languages: Dwarvish or one other of your choice if you already speak Dwarvish Equipment: A set of artisan’s tools with which you are proficient, a maker’s mark chisel used to mark your handiwork with the symbol of the clan of crafters you learned your skill from, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 5 gp and a gem worth 10 gp Feature: Respect of the Stout Folk As well respected as clan crafters are among outsiders, no one esteems them quite so highly as dwarves do. You always have free room and board in any place where shield dwarves or gold dwarves dwell, and the individuals in such a settlement might vie among themselves to determine who can offer you (and possibly your compatriots) the finest accommodations and assistance. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the guild artisan background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a clan crafter. (For instance, consider the words “guild” and “clan” to be interchangeable.) Your bond is almost certainly related to the master or the clan that taught you, or else to the work that you produce. Your ideal might have to do with maintaining the high quality of your work or preserving the dwarven traditions of craftsmanship."
Cloistered Scholar,"As a child, you were inquisitive when your playmates were possessive or raucous. In your formative years, you found your way to one of Faerûn’s great institutes of learning , where you were apprenticed and taught that knowledge is a more valuable treasure than gold or gems. Now you are ready to leave your home—not to abandon it, but to quest for new lore to add to its storehouse of knowledge. The most well known of Faerûn’s fonts of knowledge is Candlekeep. The great library is always in need of workers and attendants, some of whom rise through the ranks to assume roles of greater responsibility and prominence. You might be one of Candlekeep’s own, dedicated to the curatorship of what is likely the most complete body of lore and history in all the world. Perhaps instead you were taken in by the scholars of the Vault of the Sages or the Map House in Silverymoon, and now you have struck out to increase your knowledge and to make yourself available to help those in other places who seek your expertise. You might be one of the few who aid Herald’s Holdfast, helping to catalogue and maintain records of the information that arrives daily from across Faerûn. Skill Proficiencies: History, plus your choice of one from among Arcana, Nature, and Religion Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: The scholar’s robes of your cloister, a writing kit (small pouch with a quill, ink, folded parchment, and a small penknife), a borrowed book on the subject of your current study, and a pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Library Access Though others must often endure extensive interviews and significant fees to gain access to even the most common archives in your library, you have free and easy access to the majority of the library, though it might also have repositories of lore that are too valuable, magical, or secret to permit anyone immediate access. You have a working knowledge of your cloister’s personnel and bureaucracy, and you know how to navigate those connections with some ease. Additionally, you are likely to gain preferential treatment at other libraries across the Realms, as professional courtesy shown to a fellow scholar. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the sage background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a cloistered scholar. Your bond is almost certainly associated either with the place where you grew up or with the knowledge you hope to acquire through adventuring. Your ideal is no doubt related to how you view the quest for knowledge and truth—perhaps as a worthy goal in itself, or maybe as a means to a desirable end."
Courtier,"In your earlier days, you were a personage of some significance in a noble court or a bureaucratic organization. You might or might not come from an upper-class family; your talents, rather than the circumstances of your birth, could have secured you this position. You might have been one of the many functionaries, attendants, and other hangers-on in the Court of Silverymoon, or perhaps you traveled in Waterdeep’s baroque and sometimes cutthroat conglomeration of guilds, nobles, adventurers, and secret societies. You might have been one of the behind-the-scenes law-keepers or functionaries in Baldur’s Gate or Neverwinter, or you might have grown up in and around the castle of Daggerford. Even if you are no longer a full-fledged member of the group that gave you your start in life, your relationships with your former fellows can be an advantage for you and your adventuring comrades. You might undertake missions with your new companions that further the interest of the organization that gave you your start in life. In any event, the abilities that you honed while serving as a courtier will stand you in good stead as an adventurer. Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Persuasion Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: A set of fine clothes and a pouch containing 5 gp Feature: Court Functionary Your knowledge of how bureaucracies function lets you gain access to the records and inner workings of any noble court or government you encounter. You know who the movers and shakers are, whom to go to for the favors you seek, and what the current intrigues of interest in the group are. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the guild artisan background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a courtier. The noble court or bureaucratic organization where you got your start is directly or indirectly associated with your bond (which could pertain to certain individuals in the group, such as your sponsor or mentor). Your ideal might be concerned with the prevailing philosophy of your court or organization."
Criminal,"You are an experienced criminal and still have contacts within the criminal underworld. Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Steal⁠th Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, thieves’ tools Equipment: A crowbar, a set of dark common clothes including a hood, and a pouch containing 15 gp Criminal Specialty There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves’ guild or similar criminal organization, members have particular specialties. Choose the role you played in your criminal life, or roll on the table below. d8 Specialty d8 Specialty 1 Blackmailer 5 Highway robber 2 Burglar 6 Hired killer 3 Enforcer 7 Pickpocket 4 Fence 8 Smuggler Feature: Criminal Contact You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other criminals. You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you. Suggested Characteristics d8 Personality Trait 1 I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong. 2 I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me. 3 The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable—or where such things could be hidden. 4 I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy. 5 I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide. 6 I don’t pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds. 7 The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can’t do it. 8 I blow up at the slightest insult. d6 Ideal 1 Honor. I don’t steal from others in the trade. (Lawful) 2 Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic) 3 Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good) 4 Greed. I will do whatever it takes to become wealthy. (Evil) 5 People. I’m loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care. (Neutral) 6 Redemption. There’s a spark of good in everyone. (Good) d6 Bond 1 I’m trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor. 2 My ill-gotten gains go to support my family. 3 Something important was taken from me, and I aim to steal it back. 4 I will become the greatest thief that ever lived. 5 I’m guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it. 6 Someone I loved died because of I mistake I made. That will never happen again. d6 Flaw 1 When I see something valuable, I can’t think about anything but how to steal it. 2 When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money. 3 If there’s a plan, I’ll forget it. If I don’t forget it, I’ll ignore it. 4 I have a “tell” that reveals when I’m lying. 5 I turn tail and run when things look bad. 6 An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I’m okay with that."
Dimir Operative,"You’re a spy. Secrets and misinformation are your stock in trade. You skulk in the shadows, infiltrate other guilds, and steal the most precious secrets, whether they’re written in locked journals or hidden away in someone’s mind. Even you might not be aware of all the reasons behind the missions you carry out. Sometimes a mission’s sole purpose is to conceal the motivation behind another strike performed in a different part of the city, or simply to spread fear. As part of your covert work for House Dimir , you maintain a false identity as a member of another guild. You can choose your secondary guild or roll to determine it randomly. This secondary guild membership determines a portion of your starting equipment and is also where most of your contacts come from. You infiltrate your secondary guild to learn its secrets, keep tabs on its activities, or perhaps undermine it from within. Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Stealth Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A Dimir insignia, three small knives, a set of dark-colored common clothes, and the starting equipment of the background described in this chapter for your secondary guild Feature: False Identity You have more than one identity. The one you wear most of the time makes you appear to be a member of a guild other than House Dimir . You have documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona and fit into the secondary guild. Whenever you choose, you can drop this identity and blend into the guildless masses of the city. Consider why you’re embedded in the secondary guild. Create a story with your DM, inspired by rolling on the following table or choosing a reason that suits you. d8 Reason for Infiltration 1 My parents belong to this guild, and I let them think I’m following in their footsteps. 2 I’ve been assigned to track this guild’s activities. 3 I’ve been assigned to get close to an individual in this guild and learn their secrets. 4 I’ve been assigned to recruit a new Dimir spy from the ranks of this guild. 5 I was a member of this guild before the Dimir recruited me. 6 I don’t like what this guild stands for and want to destroy it from within. 7 I secretly wish I could leave the Dimir and join this guild, but there is no escaping the Dimir . 8 I chose this guild at random or on a lark. Dimir Guild Spells Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature For you, the spells on the Dimir Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.) Dimir Guild Spells Spell Level Spells Cantrip encode thoughts , mage hand 1st disguise self , sleep 2nd detect thoughts , pass without trace 3rd gaseous form , meld into stone , nondetection 4th arcane eye , freedom of movement 5th modify memory Your magic is meant to be subtle and undetectable, but it might pull shadows or clouds of mist around you as you cast your spells. Using the encode thoughts cantrip described below, you can turn a creature’s thoughts (including your own) into a thought strand that others can potentially read, share, or steal. These thought strands are treated as valuable currency among the Dimir . Suggested Characteristics Skilled at infiltration, disguise, and deception, members of House Dimir appear inscrutable. Your true personality and ideals might never manifest, or they might mark you as a quirky member of your secondary guild. Personality Traits d8 Personality Traits 1 I’m good at hiding my true thoughts and feelings. 2 When I’m in doubt about revealing something, I assume it’s a secret, and I don’t share it. 3 I like to sound mysterious, because wisdom hidden grows deeper with time. 4 I have no patience with people who get in my way. 5 I love hearing about other people’s nightmares. 6 Combat is meant to be quick, clean, and one-sided. 7 I like to stick to the shadows. 8 I never show my anger. I just plot my revenge. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Guild. My true guild is all that really matters. (Any) 2 Control. I like pulling the strings. (Lawful) 3 Secrets. I collect secrets and never reveal them. (Any) 4 Knowledge. I want to know as much as I can about this city and how it works. (Any) 5 Independence. I value the freedom to pursue my own goals without interference. (Chaotic) 6 Nihilism. I don’t believe in anything, and anyone who does is a fool. (Neutral) Bonds d6 Bond 1 I discovered a secret I can’t let anyone else uncover—including my guild superiors. 2 I formed a close friendship or romance with someone in the guild I’m infiltrating. 3 The Dimir agent who recruited me was unmasked and killed. My revenge on the killers will be thorough and painful. 4 I spend as much time as I can in the Ismeri Library because I’m certain an information hub operates behind its facade. I want its secrets! 5 I’m utterly loyal to my superior in the guild, more than to the guild or its guildmaster . 6 Someone has discovered my true identity. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I like secrets so much that I’m reluctant to share details of a plan even with those who need to know. 2 I would let my friends die rather than reveal my true identity. 3 I have trouble trusting anyone but myself. 4 I have a particular vice that puts all my secrets at risk if I’m not careful. 5 I’m pretty sure I’ve done something horrible that I can’t remember because of the guild’s mind magic. 6 I put too much trust in the people who give me orders."
Entertainer,"You thrive in front of an audience. You know how to entrance them, entertain them, and even inspire them. Your poetics can stir the hearts of those who hear you, awakening grief or joy, laughter or anger. Your music raises their spirits or captures their sorrow. Your dance steps captivate, your humor cuts to the quick. Whatever techniques you use, your art is your life. Skill Proficiencies: Acrobatics, Performance Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, one type of musical instrument Equipment: A musical instrument (one of your choice), the favor of an admirer (love letter, lock of hair, or trinket), a costume, and a pouch containing 15 gp Entertainer Routines A good entertainer is versatile⁠, spicing up every performance with a variety of different routines. Choose one to three routines or roll on the table below to define your specialties. d10 Entertainer Routine d10 Entertainer Routine 1 Ac⁠tor 6 Instrumentalist 2 Dancer 7 Poet 3 Fire-eater 8 Singer 4 Jester 9 Storyteller 5 Juggle 10 Tumbler Feature: By Popular Demand You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble’s court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you. Suggested Characteristics d8 Personality Trait 1 I know a story relevant to almost every situation. 2 Whenever I come to a new place, I collect local rumors and spread gossip. 3 I’m a hopeless romantic, always searching for that “special someone.” 4 Nobody stays angry at me or around me for long, since I can defuse any amount of tension. 5 I love a good insult, even one directed at me. 6 I get bitter if I’m not the center of attention. 7 I’ll settle for nothing less than perfection. 8 I change my mood or my mind as quickly as I change key in a song. d6 Ideal 1 Beauty. When I perform, I make the world better than it was. (Good) 2 Tradition. The stories, legends, and songs of the past must never be forgotten, for they teach us who we are. (Lawful) 3 Creativity. The world is in need of new ideas and bold action. (Chaotic) 4 Greed. I’m only in it for the money and fame. (Evil) 5 People. I like seeing the smiles on people’s faces when I perform. That’s all that matters. (Neutral) 6 Honesty. Art should reflect the soul; it should come from within and reveal who we really are. (Any) d6 Bond 1 My instrument is my most treasured possession, and it reminds me of someone I love. 2 Someone stole my precious instrument, and someday I’ll get it back. 3 I want to be famous, whatever it takes. 4 I idolize a hero of the old tales and measure my deeds against that person’s. 5 I will do anything to prove myself superior to my hated rival. 6 I would do anything for the other members of my old troupe. d6 Flaw 1 I’ll do anything to win fame and renown. 2 I’m a sucker for a pretty face. 3 A scandal prevents me from ever going home again. That kind of trouble seems to follow me around. 4 I once satirized a noble who still wants my head. It was a mistake that I will likely repeat. 5 I have trouble keeping my true feelings hidden. My sharp tongue lands me in trouble. 6 Despite my best efforts, I am unreliable to my friends."
Faceless,"Being who you are, you could never be a hero. Whether due to your class, your people, your family, or your sins, something about you prevents you from effectively pursuing the path you’ve chosen. Even so, that doesn’t stop you. You’ve left your old face behind, taking on a new persona, becoming something more. Characters with the faceless background don a disguise—literally or otherwise—as they adventure. This persona might be dramatic or subtle. In a way, though, many characters have such larger than life personalities. Therefore, this background largely focuses on detailing the hero behind the mask. Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Intimidation Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A disguise kit, a costume, a pouch containing 10 gp Faceless Persona A faceless character adventures behind the mask of a public persona. This persona is as natural to them as their hidden, true face, but it disguises their identity. Roll on the Faceless Persona table to determine your persona, or work with the DM to create a persona that’s unique to your character and suits the tone of your game. Faceless Persona d10 Persona 1 A flamboyant spy or brigand 2 The incarnation of a nation or people 3 A scoundrel with a masked guise 4 A vengeful spirit 5 The manifestation of a deity or your faith 6 One whose beauty is greatly accented using makeup 7 An impersonation of another hero 8 The embodiment of a school of magic 9 A warrior with distinctive armor 10 A disguise with animalistic or monstrous characteristics, meant to inspire fear Feature: Dual Personalities Most of your fellow adventurers and the world know you as your persona. Those who seek to learn more about you—your weaknesses, your origins, your purpose—find themselves stymied by your disguise. Upon donning a disguise and behaving as your persona, you are unidentifiable as your true self. By removing your disguise and revealing your true face, you are no longer identifiable as your persona. This allows you to change appearances between your two personalities as often as you wish, using one to hide the other or serve as convenient camouflage. However, should someone realize the connection between your persona and your true self, your deception might lose its effectiveness. Suggested Characteristics A faceless character usually plays their persona—the hero or extraordinary person they are every day. That’s all a facade, though, or a part of them expressed to an extreme. To define a persona, feel free to choose characteristics from other backgrounds, particularly folk hero, hermit, or noble. For the person behind the persona, the one who truly strives to be faceless, consider a distinct set of faceless characteristics. As a result, those with this background have two sets of characteristics, one for their persona, and one for their faceless selves. Faceless Personality Traits d8 Personality Traits 1 I’m earnest and uncommonly direct. 2 I strive to have no personality—it’s easier to forget what’s hardly there. 3 I treasure a memento of the person or instance that set me upon my path. 4 I sleep just as much as I need to and on an unusual schedule. 5 I think far ahead, a detachedness often mistaken for daydreaming. 6 I cultivate a single obscure hobby or study and eagerly discuss it at length. 7 I am ever learning how to be among others—when to stay quiet, when to laugh. 8 I behave like an extreme opposite of my persona. Faceless Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Justice. Place in society shouldn’t determine one’s access to what is right. (Good) 2 Security. Doing what must be done can’t bring the innocent to harm. (Lawful) 3 Confusion. Deception is a weapon. Strike from where your foes won’t expect. (Chaotic) 4 Infamy. My name will be a malediction, a curse that fulfills my will. (Evil) 5 Incorruptibility. Be a symbol, and leave your flawed being behind. (Any) 6 Anonymity. It’s my deeds that should be remembered, not their instrument. (Any) Faceless Bonds d6 Bond 1 I do everything for my family. My first thought is keeping them safe. 2 What I do, I do for the world. The people don’t realize how much they need me. 3 I’ve seen too many in need. I must not fail them as everyone else has. 4 I stand in opposition, less the wicked go unopposed. 5 I am exceptional. I do this because no one else can, and no one can stop me. 6 I do everything for those who were taken from me. Faceless Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I am callous about death. It comes to us all eventually. 2 I never make eye contact or hold it unflinchingly. 3 I have no sense of humor. Laughing is uncomfortable and embarrassing. 4 I overexert myself, sometimes needing to recuperate for a day or more. 5 I think far ahead, a detachedness often mistaken for daydreaming. 6 I see morality entirely in black and white."
Faction Agent,"Many organizations active in the North and across the face of Faerûn aren’t bound by strictures of geography. These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction’s operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don’t merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart. As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction in Faerûn. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an adventurer doesn’t necessarily require you to relinquish membership in your faction (though you can choose to do so), and it might enhance your status in the faction. Skill Proficiencies: Insight and one Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skill of your choice, as appropriate to your faction Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: Badge or emblem of your faction, a copy of a seminal faction text (or a code-book for a covert faction), a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp Factions of the Sword Coast The lack of large, centralized governments in the North and along the Sword Coast is likely directly responsible for the proliferation of secret societies and conspiracies in those lands. If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some possibilities. The Harpers. Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harpers’ ideals. The Order of the Gauntlet. One of the newest power groups in Faerûn, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order’s ideals, and the clergy of the order’s patron gods. The Emerald Enclave. Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods of nature. The Lords’ Alliance. On one level, the agents of the Lords’ Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance’s ideals. The Zhentarim. In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren’t necessarily criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in Deception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the Zhentarim. Feature: Safe Haven As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the acolyte background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a faction agent. (For instance, consider the words “faith” and “faction” to be interchangeable.) Your bond might be associated with other members of your faction, or a location or an object that is important to your faction. The ideal you strive for is probably in keeping with the tenets and principles of your faction, but might be more personal in nature."
Failed Merchant,"Maybe you come from a long line of merchants. Perhaps you were an entrepreneur. Regardless, your ventures ended poorly. Whether it was because of outside influences, bad luck, or simply because your business acumen was weak, you lost everything. With failure, however, comes experience. You’re free of that old life, having made some connections and learned your lessons. Prepared to pursue the life of an adventurer, your insight into the world of commerce brought you into the sphere of Acquisitions Incorporated—and a franchise just might be in your future. Skill Proficiency: Investigation, Persuasion Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools Languages: Any one of your choice Equipment: One set of artisan’s tools, merchant’s scale, a set of fine clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Supply Chain From your time as a merchant, you retain connections with wholesalers, suppliers, and other merchants and entrepreneurs. You can call upon these connections when looking for items or information. Suggested Characteristics Being a merchant involved having a head for numbers, a strong personality, the ability to make deals with hostile adversaries, a strong sword arm to fight off bandits, and the intuition for knowing what people want and need. The art of business is the art of finding the best path to profit, and that path might be different with each transaction. It takes a strong mind and a stronger stomach to succeed. So why did you fail? d8 Personal Trait 1 I didn’t have the cutthroat attitude necessary to succeed. I won’t make that mistake again. 2 Even my competitors said I was affable and talented. Those traits should serve me well. 3 To prosper, you have to be in control. 4 The customer is always right. 5 I was cutting corners and breaking deals to maximize profit. That’s why I failed. 6 When I get an idea, I am single-minded in its execution—even if it’s a terrible idea. 7 If I can be everyone’s friend, I’ll always have support. 8 My heart wasn’t in being a merchant, so I failed. I’m not all that keen on adventuring either, but I need the money. d6 Ideal 1 Survival. Where there’s life, there’s hope. If I remain alive and flexible, I can succeed. (Any) 2 Generosity. People helped me when I was down. Now that I’m back on my feet, I’ll pay it forward. (Good) 3 Excitement. Caution got me nowhere in my previous business. I’m not going to let it hold me back now. (Chaotic) 4 Wealth. With enough coin, I can buy comfort, power, knowledge, and even eternal life. Nothing will stand between me and money. (Evil) 5 Stability. The mercantile trade was too chaotic for me. I need a nice stable profession, like adventuring. (Lawful) 6 Redemption. Too many people consider me a failure. So I need to prove them wrong. (Any) d6 Bond 1 My family means everything to me. I failed them before, and I must not do so again. 2 My church provides a connection to my god, so I must ensure that it is protected and funded. 3 My former business partner fell ill, and then our business failed. Part of my new venture involves earning enough to take care of their family. 4 If I take care of my possessions, they’ll take care of me. People come and go, but a weapon or a wand is something you can always rely on. 5 Although my business failed, the people of my community were kind to me. I’ll do everything in my power to protect them. 6 I owe a dangerous person a lot of money. As long as they’re happy, they let my debt rest unpaid. d6 Flaw 1 Why spend gold here when you can buy the same thing for copper in the next town? 2 I must have the best of everything. Like, right now. 3 You haven’t heard of me? I’m sure that’s because of your ignorance and low breeding. 4 I failed, but I’m awesome. So when anyone else is successful, it must be because of nepotism, dishonesty, or dumb luck. 5 I find that most people are trustworthy. Hey, where’s my belt pouch? 6 Nothing gets between me and danger except my fellow adventurers. So I’ll be sure to put them there."
Far Traveler,"Almost all of the common people and other folk that one might encounter along the Sword Coast or in the North have one thing in common: they live out their lives without ever traveling more than a few miles from where they were born. You aren’t one of those folk. You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of Faerûn for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share. Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land’s ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you’ve never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you’re a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go. Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Perception Tool Proficiencies: Any one musical instrument or gaming set of your choice, likely something native to your homeland Languages: Any one of your choice Equipment: One set of traveler’s clothes, any one musical instrument or gaming set you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps from your homeland that depict where you are in Faerûn, a small piece of jewelry worth 10 gp in the style of your homeland’s craftsmanship, and a pouch containing 5 gp Why Are You Here? A far traveler might have set out on a journey for one of a number of reasons, and the departure from his or her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary. To determine why you are so far from home, roll on the table below or choose from the options provided. The following section, discussing possible homelands, includes some suggested reasons that are appropriate for each location. Why Are You Here? d6 Reason 1 Emissary 2 Exile 3 Fugitive 4 Pilgrim 5 Sightseer 6 Wanderer Where Are You From? The most important decision in creating a far traveler background is determining your homeland. The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this background. Evermeet. The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faerûn. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your homeland. Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerûn for a purpose that benefits elven culture or society. Halruaa. Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faerûn who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can work magic. Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerûn for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa’s many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods of magic. Kara-Tur. The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerûn, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faerûn likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn’t your true ethnicity, because that’s the blanket term they use for everyone who shares your origin. The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerûn as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission was over. Mulhorand. From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerûn. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts of Faerûn. Those who leave behind Mulhorand’s sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of your home. Sossal. Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed in white. Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly important. Zakhara. As the saying goes among those in Faerûn who know of the place, “To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.” Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn’t unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faerûn for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as you have. You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your own deities. The Underdark. Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place—but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you were a child. If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren’t a native, your reason for leaving “home” probably has something to do with getting away from a bad situation. Feature: All Eyes on You Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland. You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people. Suggested Characteristics d6 Personality Trait 1 I have different assumptions from those around me concerning personal space, blithely invading others’ space in innocence, or reacting to ignorant invasion of my own. 2 I have my own ideas about what is and is not food, and I find the eating habits of those around me fascinating, confusing, or revolting. 3 I have a strong code of honor or sense of propriety that others don’t comprehend. 4 I express affection or contempt in ways that are unfamiliar to others. 5 I honor my deities through practices that are foreign to this land. 6 I begin or end my day with small traditional rituals that are unfamiliar to those around me. d6 Ideal 1 Open.

(Any) d6 Bond 1 So long as I have this token from my homeland, I can face any adversity in this strange land. 2 The gods of my people are a comfort to me so far from home. 3 I hold no greater cause than my service to my people. 4 My freedom is my most precious possession. I’ll never let anyone take it from me again. 5 I’m fascinated by the beauty and wonder of this new land. 6 Though I had no choice, I lament having to leave my loved one(s) behind. I hope to see them again one day. d6 Flaw 1 I am secretly (or not so secretly) convinced of the superiority of my own culture over that of this foreign land. 2 I pretend not to understand the local language in order to avoid interactions I would rather not have. 3 I have a weakness for the new intoxicants and other pleasures of this land. 4 I don’t take kindly to some of the actions and motivations of the people of this land, because these folk are different from me. 5 I consider the adherents of other gods to be deluded innocents at best, or ignorant fools at worst. 6 I have a weakness for the exotic beauty of the people of these lands."

Feylost,"You grew up in the Feywild after disappearing from your home plane as a child. Perhaps you were spirited away by kindly Fey who thought you were destined for great things. Perhaps you stumbled through a fey crossing by chance during a twilight stroll in the woods. Perhaps you were kidnapped by evil Fey but escaped from their clutches. Whatever the manner of your disappearance, you gradually fell under the Feywild’s spell and learned a little about the nature of the mercurial tricksters that dwell there. When you finally returned to your home plane, you did not come back unchanged. You are haunted by the fact that the Feywild—a mirror world hidden behind a mere twist of perception—is only a hair’s breadth away. Although your memories of the Feywild grow fainter with each passing day, your heart swells with a mixture of fear and joy at the prospect of one day venturing back to the Plane of Faerie—your home away from home. Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Survival Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument Languages: One of your choice of Elvish, Gnomish, Goblin, or Sylvan Equipment: A musical instrument (one of your choice), a set of traveler’s clothes, three trinkets (each determined by rolling on the Feywild Trinkets table), and a pouch containing 8 gp Fey Mark You were transformed in some small way by your stay in the Feywild and gained a fey mark, determined by rolling on the Fey Mark table. Fey Mark d8 Fey Mark 1 Your eyes swirl with iridescent colors. 2 You have a sweet scent, like that of nectar or honey. 3 You have long whiskers like those of a cat. 4 Your ears are covered with soft tufts of fur. 5 Your skin sparkles in moonlight. 6 Flowers either bloom or wilt (your choice) in your presence. 7 Your hair is made of vines or brambles and grows back to normal length within 1 hour of being cut. 8 You have a tail like that of a dog or another animal. Feywild Visitor Whenever you’re sound asleep or in a deep trance during a long rest, a spirit of the Feywild might pay you a visit, if the DM wishes it. Determine the spirit’s form by rolling on the Feywild Visitor table. No harm ever comes to you as a result of such visits, which can last for minutes or hours, and you remember each visit when you wake up. Conversations that occur with a visitor can contain any number of things, from messages and insights to nonsense and red herrings, at the DM’s discretion. Such conversations are always conducted in a language you can understand, even if the Feywild visitor can’t speak that language normally. Feywild Visitor d8 Visitor 1 Awakened creature (a Beast or an ordinary plant that has had the awaken spell cast on it) 2 Centaur 3 Dryad 4 Faerie dragon 5 Pixie 6 Satyr 7 Sprite 8 Unicorn Feature: Feywild Connection Your mannerisms and knowledge of fey customs are recognized by natives of the Feywild, who see you as one of their own. Because of this, friendly Fey creatures are inclined to come to your aid if you are lost or need help in the Feywild. Character Traits As the players choose backgrounds for their characters, they can use the following tables to help determine their characters’ personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Players can use these tables instead of the ones that appear in the Player’s Handbook , or they can mix and match them. If a rolled result doesn’t make sense for a character, the player can roll again or choose a more appropriate entry on the table. These tables, while optional, are well suited to Feywild-themed adventures and are ideal for any character who has the feylost or Witchlight hand background. Personality Traits d8 Trait 1 I’m haunted by fey laughter that only I can hear, though I know it’s just my mind playing tricks on me. 2 Like a nomad, I can’t settle down in one place for very long. 3 Good music makes me weep like a baby. 4 Wherever I go, I try to bring a little of the warmth and tranquility of home with me. 5 I have never lost my childlike sense of wonder. 6 When I have a new idea, I get wildly excited about it until I come up with another, better idea. 7 I live by my own set of weird and wonderful rules. 8 I can’t bring myself to trust most adults. Ideals d8 Ideal 1 Friendship. I never leave a friend behind. (Good) 2 Empathy. No creature should be made to suffer. (Good) 3 Wanderlust. I prefer to take the less traveled path. (Chaotic) 4 Changeability. Change is good, which is why I live by an ever-changing set of rules. (Chaotic) 5 Honor. A deal is a deal, and I would never break one. (Lawful) 6 Rule of Three. Everything in the multiverse happens in threes. I see the “rule of three” everywhere. (Lawful) 7 Obsession. I won’t let go of a grudge. (Evil) 8 Greed. I will do whatever it takes to get what I want, regardless of the harm it might cause. (Evil) Bonds d8 Bond 1 I would never break my word. 2 I find magic in all its forms to be compelling. The more magical a place, the more I am drawn to it. 3 I do what I can to protect the natural world. 4 A trusted friend is the most important thing in the multiverse to me. 5 I can’t bring myself to harm a Fey creature, either because I consider myself one or because I fear the repercussions. 6 The Witchlight Carnival feels like home to me. 7 I’m drawn to the Feywild and long to return there, if only for a short while. 8 I feel indebted to Mister Witch and Mister Light for giving me a home and a purpose. Flaws d8 Flaw 1 I easily lose track of time. My poor sense of time means I’m always late. 2 I think the whole multiverse is out to get me. 3 I’m always operating under a tight timeline, and I’m obsessed with keeping everything on schedule. 4 I’m a kleptomaniac who covets shiny, sparkling treasure. 5 I’m forgetful. Sometimes I can’t remember even the simplest things. 6 I never give away anything for free and always expect something in return. 7 I have many vices and tend to indulge them. 8 I’m always changing my mind—well, almost always."
Fisher,"Fisher You have spent your life aboard fishing vessels or combing the shallows for the bounty of the ocean. Perhaps you were born into a family of fisher folk, working with your kin to feed your village. Maybe the job was a means to an end—a way out of an undesirable circumstance that forced you to take up life aboard a ship. Regardless of how you began, you soon fell in love with the sea, the art of fishing, and the promise of the eternal horizon. Skill Proficiencies: History, Survival Languages: One of your choice Equipment: Fishing tackle, a net, a favorite fishing lure or oiled leather wading boots, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Harvest the Water You gain advantage on ability checks made using fishing tackle. If you have access to a body of water that sustains marine life, you can maintain a moderate lifestyle while working as a fisher, and you can catch enough food to feed yourself and up to ten other people each day. Fishing Tale You can tell a compelling tale, whether tall or true, to impress and entertain others. Once a day, you can tell your story to willing listeners. At the DM’s discretion, a number of those listeners become friendly toward you; this is not a magical effect, and continued amicability on their part depends on your actions. You can roll on the following table to help determine the theme of your tale or choose one that best fits your character. Alternatively, work with your DM to create your own fishing tale. d8 Tale 1 Lobster Wrestling. You fought in hand-to-hand combat with an immense lobster. 2 It Dragged the Boat. You nearly caught a fish of monstrous size that pulled your boat for miles. 3 Fins of Pure Gold. You caught a sea animal whose fins were made of pure gold, but another fisher stole it. 4 Ghost Fish. You are haunted by a ghostly fish that only you can see. 5 Nemesis Clam. A large clam containing a pearl the size of your head claimed one of your fingers before jetting away; one day, you’ll find that clam. 6 It Swallowed the Sun. You once saw a fish leap from the water and turn day into night. 7 Dive into the Abyss. You found yourself in an underwater cave leading to the Abyss, and your luck has been sour ever since. 8 Love Story. You fell in love with a creature of pure water, but your brief romance ended tragically. Suggested Characteristics Fishers succeed only if they spend time at their jobs. As such, most fishers have a strong work ethic, and they admire others who earn their living honestly. Fishers tend to be superstitious, forming attachments to particular fishing lures or special fishing spots. They have a connection to the bodies of water in which they fish, and they think poorly of those whose actions adversely affect their livelihood. Fisher Personality Traits d8 Personality Traits 1 I am unmoved by the wrath of nature. 2 My friends are my crew; we sink or float together. 3 I need long stretches of quiet to clear my head. 4 Rich folk don’t know the satisfaction of hard work. 5 I laugh heartily, feel deeply, and fear nothing. 6 I work hard; nature offers no handouts. 7 I dislike bargaining; state your price and mean it. 8 Luck favors me, and I take risks others might not. Fisher Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Camaraderie. Good people make even the longest voyage bearable. (Good) 2 Luck. Our luck depends on respecting its rules—now throw this salt over your shoulder. (Lawful) 3 Daring. The richest bounty goes to those who risk everything. (Chaotic) 4 Plunder. Take all that you can and leave nothing for the scavengers. (Evil) 5 Balance. Do not fish the same spot twice in a row; suppress your greed, and nature will reward you. (Neutral) 6 Hard Work. No wave can move a soul hard at work. (Any) Fisher Bonds d6 Bond 1 I lost something important in the deep sea, and I intend to find it. 2 Someone else’s greed destroyed my livelihood, and I will be compensated. 3 I will fish the many famous waters of this land. 4 The gods saved me during a terrible storm, and I will honor their gift. 5 My destiny awaits me at the bottom of a particular pond in the Feywild. 6 I must repay my village’s debt. Fisher Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I am judgmental, especially of those I deem homebodies or otherwise lazy. 2 I become depressed and anxious if I’m away from the sea too long. 3 I have lived a hard life and find it difficult to empathize with others. 4 I am inclined to tell long-winded stories at inopportune times. 5 I work hard, but I play harder. 6 I am obsessed with catching an elusive aquatic beast, often to the detriment of other pursuits. Saltmarsh Ties Eda Oweland and her family are the informal leaders of the fishing industry in Saltmarsh. You can always count on the Owelands for minor aid and can gain access to Eda if the need is obvious and imminent."
Gambler,"All you need to make a lot of gold is a little gold. Except at those times when all you need to have no gold at all is a little gold. Whether you’re a good gambler or a bad one rarely matters, because no one can divine the whims of Lady Luck. Sometimes you’re up, sometimes you’re down. But the thing about gambling is that someone is always willing to take a bet. Skill Proficiency: Deception, Insight Tool Proficiencies: One gaming set Languages: Any one of your choice Equipment: One gaming set, a lucky charm, a set of fine clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp Feature: Never Tell Me the Odds Odds and probability are your bread and butter. During downtime activities that involve games of chance or figuring odds on the best plan, you can get a solid sense of which choice is likely the best one and which opportunities seem too good to be true, at the DM’s determination. Suggested Characteristics Some gamble out of necessity. Others do so out of boredom. Still others become addicted to the thrill of winning or losing everything on a turn of fortune. For some, gambling is less a matter of chance and more a matter of seeking every advantage to ensure the outcome. The best gamblers can lose everything, and the worst gamblers sometimes win. Regardless, you can always tell gamblers by the look in their eyes. Lady Luck haunts them. d8 Personality Trait 1 I plan for every contingency. Leave nothing to chance! 2 Every copper wants to be a silver. Each bet is an opportunity. 3 I’m one of Lady Luck’s favored. Anything I try is destined to succeed. 4 I’ve lost so much to gambling that I refuse to spend money on anything anymore. 5 Nothing is certain. Planning is a coward’s act. 6 I can’t be sure who I’ve swindled, cheated, or defeated, so I keep a low profile in public. 7 The perfect bet is out there somewhere. I just have to keep my eyes open. 8 I have beaten my addiction, but all it takes is one weak moment and I’ll be back at the card table. d6 Ideal 1 Knowledge. Knowledge is power, and knowing which horse to back is the key to success. (Any) 2 Fate. Whatever happens is fated, regardless of any planning or striving. (Lawful) 3 Bravery. If you want to succeed, you have to take risks. (Chaotic) 4 Survival. You can’t win if you’re dead. Live to fight another day—when the odds might be more in your favor. (Any) 5 Reliability. When I was in need, I was able to rely on others. Now I want to be the one others rely on. (Good) 6 Victory. Winning is the real measure of a person. In the end, the only thing that matters is the scoreboard. (Evil) d6 Bond 1 One person in particular owes me a lot of money, and I need to keep them alive if I want to be repaid. 2 I’m loyal to the friend or family member who taught me how to gamble. 3 The person who saved me from my gambling addiction is the only reason I’m alive today. 4 A patron once fronted me money in exchange for a percentage of my winnings. I owe them a debt of gratitude. And a lot of cash. 5 A criminal syndicate I once played for isn’t happy I left the game, and its enforcers are looking for me. 6 Urchins once helped me find marks for my games. Now I’m driven to help them escape the streets. d6 Flaw 1 I don’t know when to quit. Especially when everyone else is telling me to. 2 I save my sympathy for my friends, and I have no friends. 3 You think we’re in trouble now? Let me tell you how bad things are likely to get! 4 You can loan me a little, right? I’ve got a sure thing. I’ll double your money, guaranteed. 5 I was once a terribly flawed person, like you. Let me tell you how you can save yourself. 6 I’m a great gambler. I’m just bad at math and logic."
Gate Warden,"A Gate Warden from the gloomy gate-town of Hopeless protects the balance of the Outlands. Prerequisite: Planescape Campaign You spent a significant amount of time somewhere influenced by intense planar forces or a portal to another plane of existence, such as one of the gate-towns in the Outlands. You’re accustomed to experiences that would leave others reeling in terror or enraptured by otherworldly beauty, and you’re as comfortable dealing with Celestials and Fiends as you are with the vendors in town (who might be one and the same). Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, Survival Languages: Two of your choice (Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal recommended) Equipment: A ring of keys to unknown locks, a blank book, an ink pen or quill, a bottle of black ink, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Planar Infusion Living in a gate-town or a similar location steeped you in planar energy. You gain the Scion of the Outer Planes feat (presented later in this chapter). In addition, you know where to find free, modest lodging and food in the community you grew up in. Building a Gate Warden Character Those who dwell for an extended time near a permanent portal to another plane absorb the essence radiating from the realm beyond. Those influenced by the same plane share similarities in behavior and even physical appearance. Suggested Characteristics. The influence of an Outer Plane shapes your perspective. The Gate Warden Personality Traits table suggests traits you might adopt for your character. Gate Warden Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 Strange events and otherworldly creatures don’t faze me. 2 I think in terms of exchange: something for something, nothing for nothing. 3 I speak with an unusual cadence. 4 I pepper my speech with words or curses borrowed from planar languages. 5 I’ve seen enough to know that you can’t take anyone at face value, so I scrutinize everyone. 6 I have a superstitious habit I picked up from my gate-town, such as touching iron when I’m nervous or arranging objects in a specific order. Gate Warden Trinkets. When you make your character, you can roll once on the Gate Warden Trinkets table, instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player’s Handbook , for your starting trinket. Gate Warden Trinkets d6 Trinket 1 A tiny vial pendant filled with a drop of honey that glows faintly 2 A small lead ingot that has a strange thumbprint pressed into it and whispers when held tightly 3 Two lodestone spheres that chime when they attract each other 4 A smoldering pebble of coal that, while always hot, doesn’t burn skin, fur, scales, or clothing 5 A feather that sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius 6 A ring made from a chain link that, once donned, won’t come off without pulling painfully hard"
Giant Foundling,"Though you aren’t a Giant, you grew up among giants. Maybe you were an orphan taken in by a sympathetic family of stone giants who raised you as one of their own. Or perhaps you lived in a lost prehistoric pocket of the world, surrounded by giants and fearsome behemoths or hulking dinosaurs. Something about your environment—perhaps the food or water that sustained you, elemental magic inherent in the site of your home, or some verdant blessing of growth placed on you—caused you to grow to a remarkable size for your kind. With the aid of this magic, you have learned how to embody the might of giants. You are used to moving through a world much bigger than you, and that is reflected in your skills, attitude, and perspective on life. Skill Proficiencies: Intimidation, Survival Languages: Giant and one other language of your choice Equipment: A backpack, a set of traveler’s clothes, a small stone or sprig that reminds you of home, and a pouch containing 10 gp Origin Stories How you came to live among colossal creatures is up to you to determine, but the Foundling Origin table suggests a variety of possibilities. Foundling Origin d6 Origin 1 You were found as a baby by a family of nomadic giants who raised you as one of their own. 2 A family of stone giants rescued you when you fell into a mountain chasm, and you have lived with them underground ever since. 3 You were lost or abandoned as a child in a jungle that teemed with ravenous dinosaurs. There, you found an equally lost frost giant; together, you survived. 4 Your farm was crushed and your family killed in a battle between warring groups of giants. Racked with guilt over the destruction, a sympathetic giant soldier promised to care for you. 5 After you had a series of strange dreams as a child, your superstitious parents sent you to study with a powerful but aloof storm giant oracle. 6 While playing hide-and-seek with your friends, you stumbled into the castle of a cloud giant, who immediately adopted you. Feature: Strike of the Giants You gain the Strike of the Giants feat. Building a Giant Foundling Character Your life among giants has given you a unique perspective. Though you are unusually large for your kind, you’re no larger than a giant child, so you might be very mindful of your size. Suggested Characteristics. The Giant Foundling Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character. Giant Foundling Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 What I lack in stature compared to giants, I make up for with sheer spite. 2 I insist on being taken seriously as a full-grown adult. Nobody talks down to me! 3 Crowded spaces make me uncomfortable. I’d much rather be in an open field than a bustling tavern. 4 I embrace my shorter stature. It helps me stay unnoticed—and underestimated. 5 Every avalanche begins as a single pebble. 6 The world always feels too big, and I’m afraid I’ll never find my place in it."
Golgari Agent,"You are a member of a teeming horde—one small part of a sprawling organism. Just as you are part of the swarm, the swarm is part of a larger ecosystem, a never-ending cycle of life, death, rot, and rebirth. You have spent your life in the slow churn of that ecosystem, in the dark places of the city where the messy parts of existence are on display. There is little squeamishness among the Golgari , no fear of death or taboo about the dead, just a fierce affirmation of the cycle. Skill Proficiencies: Nature, Survival Tool Proficiencies: Poisoner’s kit Languages: Choose one of Elvish, Giant, or Kraul Equipment: A Golgari insignia, a poisoner’s kit, a pet beetle or spider, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp worth of mixed coins Feature: Undercity Paths You know hidden, underground pathways that you can use to bypass crowds, obstacles, and observation as you move through the city. When you aren’t in combat, you and companions you lead can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow. The paths of the undercity are haunted by dangers that rarely brave the light of the surface world, so your journey isn’t guaranteed to be safe. Golgari Guild Spells Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature For you, the spells on the Golgari Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.) Golgari Guild Spells Spell Level Spells Cantrip dancing lights, spare the dying 1st entangle, ray of sickness 2nd protection from poison, ray of enfeeblement, spider climb 3rd animate dead, plant growth 4th giant insect, grasping vine 5th cloudkill, insect plague Golgari magic is often accompanied by a sickly green glow and a rotting stench. Suggested Characteristics Members of the Golgari Swarm are unmistakably products of the undercity, ill at ease amid the comforts of civilization. They bring about the same discomfort in others by reminding them of death’s inevitable approach. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 Remember, I could kill you in your sleep. Or put centipedes in your bedroll. 2 I like to remind people of their inevitable demise. 3 Sometimes I give voice to the whispers of the rot, which I hear but no one else does. 4 I do my best to discourage anyone from approaching or talking to me. 5 I have accepted my death. Hence, I don’t fear it. 6 Like roots growing through stone, I am relentless and determined in my action. 7 I put my knowledge of anatomy to use by narrating the injuries my enemies suffer in grisly detail. 8 Like a wild animal, I lash out viciously when I’m provoked—and I’m easily provoked.

The natural world is more important than the edifices of the city and civilization. (Neutral) 4 Interdependence. We are all part of nature’s web. (Lawful) 5 Ambition. The time of Golgari ascendance is at hand, and I intend to have a prominent place in the new world order. (Evil) 6 Live and Let Live.

(Neutral) Bonds d6 Bond 1 I cherish the finger of a family member who was petrified by a medusa. 2 I have an identical twin who is as different from me as any person could be. 3 I want to lead one faction of the guild to a new position of dominance. 4 I love spending time in the moss-covered building where I took part in my first reclamation mission. 5 I found something in the sewer that must never come to light. 6 I am forever grateful to the reclaimer who found me floating facedown in the sewer, moments from death. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 Death comes for us all, so you can’t expect me to take care of someone who can’t fight it off. 2 I assume that anyone outside the Golgari looks down on me. 3 I feel a need for revenge against those who enjoy the privilege of living above ground. 4 I don’t bother to couch my opinions in flattering words. 5 I can’t help but pocket any trinket or coin I come across, no matter how worthless. 6 I’m convinced that I’m better and stronger than members of other guilds, isolated as they are from the realities of life and death."
Grinner,"The Golden Grin began in the far-off land of Tal’Dorei, trading secret messages through a network of bards and minstrels to undermine an iron-fisted king’s authoritarian rule. Today, Tal’Dorei is a relatively peaceful republic, and some Grinners have grown restless while waiting for tyranny to raise its ugly head again. A contingent of such Grinners traveled to the Menagerie Coast and set up a network of secret bases in the cities of the Clovis Concord, from which they are presently working their way into the highest echelons of the Dwendalian Empire. You are a Grinner. Your goals are to spread freedom and inspire hope—or, in time, revolution—in the hearts of the oppressed. Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Performance Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument, thieves’ tools Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a disguise kit, a musical instrument of your choice, a gold-plated ring depicting a smiling face, and a pouch containing 15 gp Favorite Code-Song All members of the Golden Grin have learned a handful of folk songs in their travels, and use those songs to send secret codes and alert fellow Grinners to danger. Choose a favorite song or roll on the Favorite Code-Songs table. Favorite Code-Songs d6 Favorite Code-Song 1 Zan’s Comin’ Back. This hopeful Tal’Dorei folk song declares the inevitable return of a just ruler. Use it to seek out potential allies. 2 Blow Fire Down the Coast. A rowdy fighting song from the Clovis Concord, this ditty talks of blasting up pirate ships. Use it to encourage battle. 3 Hush! Onward Come the Dragons. This Tal’Dorei folk song recounts the terror in the days after the invasion of the red dragon called the Cinder King. Use it to encourage caution in speech and deed. 4 Let the Sword Grow Rust. An antiwar anthem from Marquet, this song has uncertain origins. Use it to help quell violent encounters. 5 Drink Deep, Li’l Hummingbird. A drinking rondo from the Menagerie Coast, this song tells the tale of a young person who drinks so heavily that they awaken to find they’ve stowed away on a ship. Use it to encourage alertness in social situations. 6 Dirge for the Emerald Fire. This elven song supposedly has thousands of obscure verses. Use the first two verses to spread news of death or defeat. Feature: Ballad of the Grinning Fool Like every Grinner, you know how to find a hideout. In any city of 10,000 people or more on the Menagerie Coast or in the lands of the Dwendalian Empire, you can play the “Ballad of the Grinning Fool” in a major tavern or inn. A member of the Golden Grin will find you and give shelter to you and any companions you vouch for. This shelter might be discontinued if it becomes too dangerous to hide you, at the DM’s discretion. This feature must be used with caution, for not all who know the ballad are your friends. Some are traitors, counterspies, or agents of tyranny. Suggested Characteristics Grinners are trained in the art of secrecy and innuendo, and are skilled at hiding in plain sight by being the loudest and brightest person in the room. Their skills in subterfuge and combat lend themselves well to an adventuring lifestyle, and traveling with mercenaries and treasure hunters creates a convenient excuse to journey through lands bent under tyranny. Grinner Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I love the spotlight. Everyone, look at me! 2 Give me a drink and I’m your friend. 3 Talk to me about yourself. I’m a hell of a listener. 4 I hate to start fights, but I love to finish them. 5 I can’t sit still. 6 I’m always humming an old tune from my past. 7 When I don’t have a reason to smile, I’m miserable. 8 I’m lucky like you wouldn’t believe.

People should be free to do as they please. (Chaotic) 6 Vigilance. A free people must be carefully taught, lest they be misled. (Neutral) Grinner Bonds d6 Bond 1 I lost someone important to an agent of the Dwendalian Empire. That regime will fall. 2 The first people to be hurt by this war will be the common folk. I need to protect them. 3 Music helped me through a dark time in my life. Now, I’ll use music to change the world. 4 I will be known as the greatest spy who ever lived. 5 All life is precious to me. I know I can change the world without taking a humanoid life. 6 The elite in their ivory towers don’t understand how we suffer. I intend to show them. Grinner Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I’ve never lied once in my life. What? No, I’m not crossing my fingers! 2 I do everything big! Subtlety? I don’t know the meaning of subtlety! Oh, that’s a problem? 3 Being a spy in wartime is painful. I’ve seen so much suffering, I think I’m losing my mind. 4 I can’t focus on my mission. I just want to carouse and sing and play! 5 Yeah, that’s my name. Yeah, I’m a Grinner spy. Who cares about staying undercover? 6 I can’t afford to trust anyone. Not. Anyone."
Gruul Anarch,"The entire world of Ravnica is a sprawling metropolis, but you are a native of the wild areas that still exist—the abandoned districts, the rubblebelts, the overgrown parks, and the crumbling ruins. You are part of a savage society that clings desperately to the Old Ways—attuned to nature, full of primal rage, and given short shrift by a world consumed with continuing civilization’s march of progress. Skill Proficiencies: Animal Handling, Athletics Tool Proficiencies: Herbalism kit Languages: Choose one of Draconic, Giant, Goblin, or Sylvan Equipment: A Gruul insignia, a hunting trap, an herbalism kit, the skull of a boar, a beast-hide cloak, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins) Feature: Rubblebelt Refuge You are intimately familiar with areas of the city that most people shun: ruined neighborhoods where wurms rampaged, overgrown parks that no hand has tended in decades, and the vast, sprawling rubblebelts of broken terrain that civilized folk have long abandoned. You can find a suitable place for you and your allies to hide or rest in these areas. In addition, you can find food and fresh water in these areas for yourself and up to five other people each day. Gruul Guild Spells Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature For you, the spells on the Gruul Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.

Gruul Guild Spells Spell Level Spells Cantrip fire bolt, produce flame 1st compelled duel, speak with animals 2nd beast sense, shatter 3rd conjure animals, conjure barrage 4th dominate beast, stoneskin 5th destructive wave Fueled by the fire of rage burning in your heart, your magic is almost always accompanied by fiery effects, such as flames smoldering behind your eyes or dancing over your hands. Suggested Characteristics Gruul ways aren’t the ways of civilized folk, and the Gruul have little patience for social niceties. But they do have cherished traditions and values, just as important to them as the different values held by the urban, cosmopolitan culture of Ravnica. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 Unlike people, the beasts of the wild are friends who won’t stab me in the back. 2 Go ahead and insult me—I dare you. 3 I scorn those who can’t survive away from the comforts of the city. 4 Don’t tell me I’m not allowed to do something. 5 Laws are for people who are afraid to face their inner beasts. 6 I smear the blood of my enemies over my skin. 7 I was, in fact, raised by maaka. 8 HarrRRAAGGHH!

Your home was anywhere you chose to spread your bedroll. There are wonders in the wilderness—strange monsters, pristine forests and streams, overgrown ruins of great halls once trod by giants—and you learned to fend for yourself as you explored them. From time to time, you guided friendly nature priests who instructed you in the fundamentals of channeling the magic of the wild."
Haunted One,"You are haunted by something so terrible that you dare not speak of it. You’ve tried to bury it and run away from it, to no avail. Whatever this thing is that haunts you can’t be slain with a sword or banished with a spell. It might come to you as a shadow on the wall, a bloodcurdling nightmare, a memory that refuses to die, or a demonic whisper in the dark. The burden has taken its toll, isolating you from most people and making you question your sanity. You must find a way to overcome it before it destroys you. Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from among Arcana, Investigation, Religion, or Survival Languages: Choose two, one of which must be Abyssal, Celestial, Deep Speech, Draconic, Infernal, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon Equipment: A monster hunter’s pack (containing a chest, a crowbar, a hammer, three wooden stakes, a holy symbol, a flask of holy water, a set of manacles, a steel mirror, a flask of oil, a tinderbox, and 3 torches), one trinket of special significance (choose one or roll on the Horror Trinkets table later in this chapter), a set of common clothes, and 1 sp Harrowing Event Prior to becoming an adventurer, your path in life was defined by one dark moment, one fateful decision, or one tragedy. Now you feel a darkness threatening to consume you, and you fear there may be no hope of escape. Choose a harrowing event that haunts you, or roll one on the Harrowing Events table. Harrowing Event d10 Event 1 A monster that slaughtered dozens of innocent people spared your life, and you don’t know why. 2 You were born under a dark star. You can feel it watching you, coldly and distantly. Sometimes it beckons you in the dead of night. 3 An apparition that has haunted your family for generations now haunts you. You don’t know what it wants, and it won’t leave you alone. 4 Your family has a history of practicing the dark arts. You dabbled once and felt something horrible clutch at your soul, whereupon you fled in terror. 5 An oni took your sibling one cold, dark night, and you were unable to stop it. 6 You were cursed with lycanthropy and later cured. You are now haunted by the innocents you slaughtered. 7 A hag kidnapped and raised you. You escaped, but the hag still has a magical hold over you and fills your mind with evil thoughts. 8 You opened an eldritch tome and saw things unfit for a sane mind. You burned the book, but its words and images are burned into your psyche. 9 A fiend possessed you as a child. You were locked away but escaped. The fiend is still inside you, but now you try to keep it bottled up. 10 You did terrible things to avenge the murder of someone you loved. You became a monster, and it haunts your waking dreams. Feature: Heart of Darkness Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone."

In those days, your only companions were the creatures of the forest and those who would occasionally visit to bring news of the outside world and supplies. The solitude allowed you to spend many hours pondering the mysteries of creation."
House Agent,"You have sworn fealty to a dragonmarked house. If you have a dragonmark, you’re likely a member of one of the house’s influential families; otherwise you’re an outsider who hopes to make your fortune through the house. Your main task is to serve as the eyes of your house, but you could be called on at any time to act as its hand. Such missions can be perilous but lucrative.

When the house assigns you a mission, it will usually provide you with the necessary supplies and transportation. Beyond this, you have many old friends, mentors, and rivals in your house, and you may encounter one of them when you interact with a house business. The degree to which such acquaintances are willing to help you depends on your current standing in your house. Suggested Characteristics House agents are diverse. Consider the house you serve and the work you do when choosing characteristics. Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 I'm always looking to improve efficiency. 2 I love to share trivia about my house's business. 3 I never gorget an insult against me or my house. 4 I'm enthusiastic about everything my house does. 5 I represent my house and take pride in my looks. 6 I'm critical of monarchies and limits on the houses.

Inheritor,"You are the heir to something of great value—not mere coin or wealth, but an object that has been entrusted to you and you alone. Your inheritance might have come directly to you from a member of your family, by right of birth, or it could have been left to you by a friend, a mentor, a teacher, or someone else important in your life. The revelation of your inheritance changed your life, and might have set you on the path to adventure, but it could also come with many dangers, including those who covet your gift and want to take it from you—by force, if need be. Skill Proficiencies: Survival, plus one from among Arcana, History, and Religion Tool Proficiencies: Your choice of a gaming set or a musical instrument Languages: Any one of your choice Equipment: Your inheritance, a set of traveler’s clothes, the tool you choose for this background’s tool proficiency, and a pouch containing 15 gp Feature: Inheritance Choose or randomly determine your inheritance from among the possibilities in the table below. Work with your Dungeon Master to come up with details: Why is your inheritance so important, and what is its full story? You might prefer for the DM to invent these details as part of the game, allowing you to learn more about your inheritance as your character does. The Dungeon Master is free to use your inheritance as a story hook, sending you on quests to learn more about its history or true nature, or confronting you with foes who want to claim it for themselves or prevent you from learning what you seek. The DM also determines the properties of your inheritance and how they figure into the item’s history and importance. For instance, the object might be a minor magic item, or one that begins with a modest ability and increases in potency with the passage of time. Or, the true nature of your inheritance might not be apparent at first and is revealed only when certain conditions are met. When you begin your adventuring career, you can decide whether to tell your companions about your inheritance right away. Rather than attracting attention to yourself, you might want to keep your inheritance a secret until you learn more about what it means to you and what it can do for you. Inheritance d8 Object or Item 1 A document such as a map, a letter, or a journal 2-3 A trinket (see “Trinkets” in chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook) 4 An article of clothing 5 A piece of jewelry 6 An arcane book or formula 7 A written story, song, poem, or secret 8 A tattoo or other body marking Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the folk hero background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as an inheritor. Your bond might be directly related to your inheritance, or to the person from whom you received it. Your ideal might be influenced by what you know about your inheritance, or by what you intend to do with your gift once you realize what it is capable of."
Investigator,"You relentlessly seek the truth. Perhaps you’re motivated by belief in the law and a sense of universal justice, or maybe that very law has failed you and you seek to make things right. You could have witnessed something remarkable or terrible, and now you must know more about this hidden truth. Or maybe you’re a detective for hire, uncovering secrets for well-paying clients. Whether the mysteries you’re embroiled in are local crimes or realm-spanning conspiracies, you’re driven by a personal need to hunt down even the most elusive clues and reveal what others would keep hidden in the shadows. An investigator considers even the strangest evidence. Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from among Insight, Investigation, or Perception Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, thieves’ tools Equipment: A magnifying glass, evidence from a past case (choose one or roll for a trinket from the Horror Trinkets table later in this chapter), a set of common clothes, and 10 gp Path to Mystery Your first case influenced the types of mysteries you’re interested in. Why was this case so impactful, personal, or traumatic? Whom did it affect besides you? Why and how did you get involved? Was it solved? How did it set you on the path to investigating other mysteries? Roll on or choose details from the First Case table to develop the mystery that started your career as an investigator. First Case d8 Case 1 A friend was wrongfully accused of murder. You tracked down the actual killer, proving your friend’s innocence and starting your career as a detective. 2 You’re told you went missing for weeks. When you were found, you had no memory of being gone. Now you search to discover what happened to you. 3 You helped a spirit find peace by finding its missing corpse. Ever since, other spectral clients have sought you out to help them find rest. 4 You revealed that the monsters terrorizing your home were illusions created by a cruel mage. The magic-user escaped, but you’ve continued to uncover magical hoaxes. 5 You were wrongfully accused and convicted of a crime. You managed to escape and seek to help others avoid the experience you suffered, even while still being pursued by the law. 6 You survived the destructive use of a magic device that wiped out your home. Members of a secret organization found you. You now work with them, tracking down dangerous supernatural phenomena and preventing them from doing harm. 7 You found evidence of a conspiracy underpinning society. You tried to expose this mysterious cabal, but no one believed you. You’re still trying to prove what you know is true. 8 You got a job with an agency that investigates crimes that local law enforcement can’t solve. You often wonder which you value more, the truth or your pay. Feature: Official Inquiry You’re experienced at gaining access to people and places to get the information you need. Through a combination of fast-talking, determination, and official-looking documentation, you can gain access to a place or an individual related to a crime you’re investigating. Those who aren’t involved in your investigation avoid impeding you or pass along your requests. Additionally, local law enforcement has firm opinions about you, viewing you as either a nuisance or one of their own."
Izzet Engineer,"Armed with an inventive intellect, a love of magical technology, and an unquenchable energy, you are an enthusiastic participant in the research work of the Izzet League . Though you’re likely to begin your career as a mere attendant, you can aspire to become a skilled mage or alchemist, a laboratory supervisor, or even a flamethrower-wielding scorchbringer tasked with defending Izzet laboratories. The Izzet are obsessive, brilliant, inspired, and an unpredictable force of chaos in Ravnica, and you epitomize all of those qualities. Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Investigation Languages: Choose one of Draconic, Goblin, or Vedalken Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools Equipment: An Izzet insignia, one set of artisan’s tools, the charred and twisted remains of a failed experiment, a hammer, a block and tackle, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins) Feature: Urban Infrastructure The popular conception of the Izzet League is based on mad inventions, dangerous experiments, and explosive blasts. Much of that perception is accurate, but the league is also involved with mundane tasks of construction and architecture—primarily in crafting the infrastructure that allows Ravnicans to enjoy running water, levitating platforms, and other magical and technological wonders. You have a basic knowledge of the structure of buildings, including the stuff behind the walls. You can also find blueprints of a specific building in order to learn the details of its construction. Such blueprints might provide knowledge of entry points, structural weaknesses, or secret spaces. Your access to such information isn’t unlimited. If obtaining or using the information gets you in trouble with the law, the guild can’t shield you from the repercussions. Izzet Guild Spells Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature For you, the spells on the Izzet Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.) Izzet Guild Spells Spell Level Spells Cantrip produce flame, shocking grasp 1st chaos bolt, create or destroy water, unseen servant 2nd heat metal, rope trick 3rd call lightning, elemental weapon, glyph of warding 4th conjure minor elementals, divination, Otiluke's resilient sphere 5th animate objects, conjure elemental Your spells tend to be loud, flashy, or explosive, even when the effect is unremarkable. For example, when you open the portal of a rope trick spell, the portal might be outlined by harmless, showy sparkles. If you use an arcane focus, it probably takes the form of an intricate device that could include metal gauntlets, glass canisters, copper tubing, and leather straps attaching it to your body. The mizzium apparatus described in chapter 5 is a magical version of this gear. The chaos bolt spell is a favorite of Izzet spellcasters because of its unpredictable nature. Suggested Characteristics Members of the Izzet League embody some combination of chaotic, frenetic energy with intellectual curiosity, in varying proportions. Some are committed to academic pursuits, and others just like explosions. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I have a hard time staying focused on … oh, and my brain tends to jump from one … did I mention focus? 2 I get really excited about my ideas and I can’t wait to talk about them and start putting them into practice and tinkering with them and I want to tell you about how exciting it all is! 3 It’s not magic—or anything, really—if you do it only halfway. Whatever I do, I give it all I’ve got. 4 I do what my gut tells me. 5 Life’s an experiment, and I can’t wait to see what happens. 6 I pepper my speech with the incomprehensible jargon of my trade, like mizzium droplets inserted into a weird-field suspension. 7 Great ideas are fine, but great results are what counts. 8 If you can guess what I’m about to do, that means I’ve run out of imagination. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any) 2 Creativity. Half the world’s troubles come from stodgy thinking, stuck in the past. We need innovative solutions. (Chaotic) 3 Discovery. Every experiment has the potential to reveal more secrets of the multiverse. (Any) 4 Science. A rigorous application of logical principles and protocols will lead us toward progress more surely than any belief system. (Lawful) 5 Fun. I love my job! Despite the dangerous working conditions, there’s nothing I’d rather do. (Chaotic) 6 Power. Someday I’ll find or create the magic that will make me the most powerful being in Ravnica. (Evil) Bonds d6 Bond 1 I have dedicated my life to finding a solution to a scientific problem. 2 I’ll never forget the laboratory where I learned my skills, or the other attendants who learned alongside me. 3 I’m convinced it was sabotage that destroyed my first laboratory and killed many of my friends, and I seek revenge against whoever did it. 4 I have the schematics for an invention that I hope to build one day, once I have the necessary resources. 5 A fellow student and I are racing to solve the same scientific puzzle. 6 I would do anything the guildmaster told me to do. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 If there’s a plan, I’ll probably forget it. If I don’t forget it, I’ll probably ignore it. 2 I get bored easily, and if nothing is happening I’ll make something happen. 3 Nothing is ever simple, and if it seems simple, I’ll find a way to make it complicated. 4 I tend to ignore sleep for days when I’m conducting research, often at the expense of my own health and safety. 5 I’m convinced there’s not a soul in Ravnica, except maybe the great Niv-Mizzet , who can match my boundless intellect. 6 I’m incapable of admitting a flaw in my logic."
Knight of Solamnia,"Prerequisite: Dragonlance Campaign You have trained to be a valorous warrior known as a Knight of Solamnia. Strict rules guide your every action, and you work to uphold them as you strive to defend the weak and oppose evil. Your honor is as important to you as your life. Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: An insignia of rank, a deck of cards, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Squire of Solamnia You gain the Squire of Solamnia feat (presented later in this chapter). In addition, the Knights of Solamnia provide you free, modest lodging and food at any of their fortresses or encampments. Building a Knight of Solamnia Character Any class that has martial prowess can be a good fit in the Knights of Solamnia. Fighters and paladins make up the bulk of the knighthood’s forces. Clerics (often with the War domain) can also be found among the knights’ ranks. For a more unusual take on a Knight of Solamnia character, consider playing a bard of the College of Valor (or the College of Swords from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything ) or a barbarian devoted to the ideals of the nature god Habbakuk (perhaps adopting the Path of the Zealot from Xanathar’s Guide to Ev erything ). Knight of Solamnia Trinkets. When you make your character, roll once on the Knight of Solamnia Trinkets table instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player’s Handbook for your starting trinket. Knight of Solamnia Trinkets d6 Trinket 1 A flat silver disk you record your heroics upon 2 A piece of a fallen knight’s armor 3 A pendant featuring a crown, a rose, or a sword 4 The pommel of your mentor’s sword 5 A meaningful favor from someone you defended—perhaps a handkerchief or glove 6 A locket with a sketch of a silver dragon inside"
Knight of the Order,"You belong to an order of knights who have sworn oaths to achieve a certain goal. The nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Faerûn has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and responsibilities. Though the term “knight” conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faerûn don’t restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren’t limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order’s cause. The “Knightly Orders of Faerûn” below details several of the orders that are active at present and is designed to help inform your decision about which group you owe allegiance to. Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate for your order Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set or musical instrument Languages: One of your choice Equipment: One set of traveler’s clothes, a signet, banner or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a pouch containing 10 gp Knightly Orders of Faerûn Many who rightfully call themselves “knight” earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor’s Eternal Order or Mystra’s Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faerûn who hear the word “knight” think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations. Knights of the Unicorn. The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriar families in Baldur’s Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue’s tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their weaknesses. Knights of Myth Drannor. Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they’ve begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant and honest. Knights of the Silver Chalice. The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe’s ethos is the nobility’s right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to the crown. Feature: Knightly Regard You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community—whether a lone settlement or a great nation—that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share those ideals. This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight in a fight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a knight of your order. Your bond almost always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a knight’s ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one’s order."
Lorehold Student,"You have spent your youth preparing to be a student of Lorehold College, reading every book on the college’s recommended reading list for prospective students. Your academic passions are in the broad field of history. You might dream of using magic to contact great historical figures or your own ancestors or of recreating the mighty magic of a distant age. Skill Proficiencies: History, Religion Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: A bottle of black ink, an ink pen, a hammer, a hooded lantern, a tinderbox, a tome of history, a school uniform, and a pouch containing 15 gp Feature: Lorehold Initiate You gain the Strixhaven Initiate feat and must choose Lorehold within it. In addition, if you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, the spells on the Lorehold Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.) Lorehold Spells Spell Level Spells 1st Comprehend Languages , Identify 2nd Borrowed Knowledge , Locate Object 3rd Speak with Dead , Spirit Guardians 4th Arcane Eye , Stone Shape 5th Flame Strike , Legend Lore Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. Your Lorehold spells might create displays of golden light. You might use a tome or a scroll as a spellcasting focus, and your spell effects might reflect the appearance of the reference books you study. Building a Lorehold Character Any class or subclass that deals with knowledge of the past can be a good fit in Lorehold. Bards thrive in Lorehold, and wizards (particularly those of the School of Divination) are numerous among its students. Clerics (often with the Knowledge or Light domains) are also quite common. For a more unusual take on a Lorehold student, you could consider playing a barbarian with a primal connection to the past (perhaps adopting the Path of the Ancestral Guardian from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything ) or a paladin whose Oath of the Ancients gives a concrete link to history. Suggested Characteristics. Methodical historians and daring adventurers alike can be found among the ranks of Lorehold college. The Lorehold Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character. Lorehold Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 I thrive on esoteric lore. The more obscure the historical references I can include in everyday conversation, the better. 2 By searching for these lost artifacts, I hope to find who I really am along the way. 3 I can barely go a minute without talking about my research. I have so much knowledge in my head, and it needs to be let out somewhere! 4 The spirits of the dead are so much more interesting to talk with than living classmates. 5 I can speak eloquently about the historical ramifications of an ancient war. But ask me to add two-digit numbers together, and I’m a mess. 6 In the end, it’s all just entropy. Everything falls apart someday. Lorehold Trinkets. When you make your character, you may roll once on the Lorehold Trinkets table, instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player’s Handbook , for your starting trinket. Lorehold Trinkets d6 Trinket 1 A map made of concentric circles that can be rotated around the page 2 A puzzle box bedecked with amber 3 A dented brass compass with a red needle 4 The head of a broken statue that houses the consciousness of a snarky sage 5 A sheet of parchment embossed with tactile lettering, glowing red 6 A broken dagger with a wavy blade and a serpentine hilt"
Mage of High Sorcery,"Prerequisite: Dragonlance Campaign Your talent for magic came to the attention of the Mages of High Sorcery, an organization of spellcasters that studies magic and prevents its misuse. You’ve trained among the Mages, but whether you’ll face the dangerous test required to become a full member of the group remains to be determined. Your passion for studying magic has likely already predisposed you toward one of the organization’s three orders: the benevolent Order of the White Robes, the balance-pursuing Order of the Red Robes, or the ruthless Order of the Black Robes. In the world of Krynn, many refer to the Mages of High Sorcery as the Wizards of High Sorcery. The organization accepts more than wizards, though, with sorcerers, warlocks, and other spellcasters included among their ranks. Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, History Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: A bottle of colored ink, an ink pen, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Initiate of High Sorcery You gain the Initiate of High Sorcery feat (presented later in this chapter). In addition, the Mages of High Sorcery provide you with free, modest lodging and food indefinitely at any occupied Tower of High Sorcery and for one night at the home of an organization member. Building a Mage of High Sorcery Character Mages of High Sorcery are typically sorcerers, warlocks, or wizards and might have any subclass. Spellcasters who gain their magic through devotion are less likely to be welcomed among the traditionalist mages. Nevertheless, the Mages of High Sorcery are shrewd, and they rarely let unique opportunities or individuals pass them by. Even members of martial classes who train in magic might find a rare place among the group’s three orders. Mage of High Sorcery Trinkets. When you make your character, roll once on the Mage of High Sorcery Trinkets table instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player’s Handbook for your starting trinket. Mage of High Sorcery Trinkets d6 Trinket 1 An unopened letter from your first teacher 2 A broken wand made of black, red, or white wood 3 A scroll bearing an incomprehensible formula 4 A purposeless device covered in colored stones that can fold into various enigmatic shapes 5 A pouch or spellbook emblazoned with the triple moon symbol of the Mages of High Sorcery 6 A lens through which you can see Krynn’s invisible black moon, Nuitari"
Marine,"Marine You were trained for battle on sandy beaches and rocky shores. You have launched midnight raids from swift ships whose names evoke terror in the hearts of your adversaries. The water is your second home, the rain your shelter, and the crashing waves your battle cry. Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival Tool Proficiencies: Vehicles (water, land) Equipment: A dagger that belonged to a fallen comrade, a folded flag emblazoned with the symbol of your ship or company, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Steady You can move twice the normal amount of time (up to 16 hours) each day before being subject to the effect of a forced march (see “Travel Pace” in chapter 8 of the Player’s Handbook). Additionally, you can automatically find a safe route to land a boat on shore, provided such a route exists. Hardship Endured Hardship in your past has forged you into an unstoppable living weapon. This hardship is essential to you and is at the heart of a personal philosophy or ethos that often guides your actions. You can roll on the following table to determine this hardship or choose one that best fits your character. d6 Hardship 1 Nearly Drowned. You hid underwater to avoid detection by enemies and held your breath for an extremely long time. Just before you would have died, you had a revelation about your existence. 2 Captured. You spent months enduring thirst, starvation, and torture at the hands of your enemy, but you never broke. 3 Sacrifice. You enabled the escape of your fellow soldiers, but at great cost to yourself. Some of your past comrades may think you’re dead. 4 Juggernaut. No reasonable explanation can explain how you survived a particular battle. Every arrow and bolt missed you. You slew scores of enemies single-handedly and led your comrades to victory. 5 Stowaway. For days, you hid in the bilge of an enemy ship, surviving on brackish water and foolhardy rats. At the right moment, you crept up to the deck and took over the ship on your own. 6 Leave None Behind. You carried an injured marine for miles to avoid capture and death. Suggested Characteristics Marines are looked up to by other soldiers and respected by their superiors. They are veteran warriors who rarely lose composure on the battlefield. Marines who leave the service tend to work as mercenaries, but their combat experience also makes them excellent adventurers. Though they are self-reliant, marines tend to operate best in groups, valuing camaraderie and the companionship of like-minded individuals. Marine Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I speak rarely but mean every word I say. 2 I laugh loudly and see the humor in stressful situations. 3 I prefer to solve problems without violence, but I finish fights decisively. 4 I enjoy being out in nature; poor weather never sours my mood. 5 I am dependable. 6 I am always working on some project or other. 7 I become cantankerous and quiet in the rain. 8 When the sea is within my sight, my mood is jovial and optimistic. Marine Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Teamwork. Success depends on cooperation and communication. (Good) 2 Code. The marines’ code provides a solution for every problem, and following it is imperative. (Lawful) 3 Embracing. Life is messy. Throwing yourself into the worst of it is necessary to get the job done. (Chaotic) 4 Might. The strong train so that they might rule those who are weak. (Evil) 5 Bravery. To act when others quake in fear—this is the essence of the warrior. (Any) 6 Perseverance. No injury or obstacle can turn me from my goal. (Any) Marine Bonds d6 Bond 1 I face danger and evil to offset an unredeemable act in my past. 2 I. Will. Finish. The. Job. 3 I must set an example of hope for those who have given up. 4 I’m searching for a fellow marine captured by an elusive enemy. 5 Fear leads to tyranny, and both must be eradicated. 6 My commander betrayed my unit, and I will have revenge. Marine Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I grow combative and unpredictable when I drink. 2 I find civilian life difficult and struggle to say the right thing in social situations. 3 My intensity can drive others away. 4 I hold grudges and have difficulty forgiving others. 5 I become irrational when innocent people are hurt. 6 I sometimes stay up all night listening to the ghosts of my fallen enemies. Saltmarsh Ties As a former member of Saltmarsh’s elite marine contingent, you are friends of Tom and Will Stoutly and can turn to them for help and support. Eliander Fireborn, captain of the guard, also makes time to listen to your concerns."
Mercenary Veteran,"As a sell-sword who fought battles for coin, you’re well acquainted with risking life and limb for a chance at a share of treasure. Now, you look forward to fighting foes and reaping even greater rewards as an adventurer. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield. You might have served with a large outfit such as the Zhentarim or the soldiers of Mintarn, or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more than one. (See the “Mercenaries of the North” for a collection of possibilities.) Now you’re looking for something else, perhaps greater reward for the risks you take, or the freedom to choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you’re leaving behind the life of a soldier for hire, but your skills are undeniably suited for battle, so now you fight on in a different way. Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Persuasion Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, vehicles (land) Equipment: A uniform of your company (traveler’s clothes in quality), an insignia of your rank, a gaming set of your choice, and a pouch containing the remainder of your last wages (10 gp) Mercenaries of the North Countless mercenary companies operate up and down the Sword Coast and throughout the North. Most are small-scale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred folk who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, or go to war in exchange for gold. Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist, and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide private armies to those with enough funds. A few organizations operating in the North are described below. The Chill. The cold and mysterious Lurkwood serves as the home of numerous groups of goblinoids that have banded together into one tribe called the Chill. Unlike most of their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the people of the North and maintains relatively good relations so that they can hire themselves out as warriors. Few city-states in the North are willing to field an army alongside the Chill, but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill to battle the Uthgardt, orcs, trolls of the Evermoors, and other threats to civilization. Silent Rain. Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote elven causes or involve destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like. Prospective employers must leave written word (in Elvish) near Evereska, and the Silent Rain sends a representative if interested. The Bloodaxes. Founded in Sundabar nearly two centuries ago, the Bloodaxes were originally a group of dwarves outcast from their clans for crimes against the teachings of Moradin Soulforger. They began hiring out as mercenaries to whoever in the North would pay them. Since then the mercenary company has broadened its membership to other races, but every member is an exile, criminal, or misfit of some sort looking for a fresh start and a new family among the bold Bloodaxes. Feature: Mercenary Life You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary companies by their emblems, and you know a little about any such company, including the names and reputations of its commanders and leaders, and who has hired them recently. You can find the taverns and festhalls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the language. You can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see “Practicing a Profession” under “Downtime Activities” in chapter 8 of the Player’s Handbook). Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a mercenary. Your bond could be associated with the company you traveled with previously, or with some of the comrades you served with. The ideal you embrace largely depends on your worldview and your motivation for fighting."

You traveled broadly, and you earned a living by buying and selling the raw materials artisans need to practice their craft or finished works from such crafters. You might have transported goods from one place to another (by ship, wagon, or caravan) or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own shop."
Noble,"Ability Scores Strength, Intelligence, Charisma Feat Skilled Skill Proficiencies History and Persuasion Tool Proficiency Choose one kind of Gaming Set Equipment Choose A or B: (A) Gaming Set (same as above), Fine Clothes, Perfume, 29 GP; or (B) 50 GP You were raised in a castle, surrounded by wealth, power, and privilege. Your family of minor aristocrats ensured that you received a first-class education, some of which you appreciated and some of which you resented. Your time in the castle, especially the many hours you spent observing your family at court, also taught you a great deal about leadership."
Orzhov Representative,"The prospect of immense wealth is the promise of membership in the Orzhov Syndicate. All of the guild’s endeavors channel wealth from Ravnican society into the ranks of the Orzhov —and concentrates the spoils at the top of the hierarchy. As a functionary in that system, your best hope is to claim as much as possible of the money that passes through your hands on its way up, so that you can work your way into a more prominent position. Regardless of your past and the wealth of your family, your initial status with the guild is near the bottom, until you have proven your value. Skill Proficiencies: Intimidation, Religion Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: An Orzhov insignia, a foot-long chain made of ten gold coins, vestments, a set of fine clothes, and a belt pouch containing 1 pp (an Orzhov-minted 10-zino coin) Feature: Leverage You can exert leverage over one or more individuals below you in the guild’s hierarchy and demand their help as needs warrant. For example, you can have a message carried across a neighborhood, procure a short carriage ride without paying, or have others clean up a bloody mess you left in an alley. The DM decides if your demands are reasonable and if there are subordinates available to fulfill them. As your status in the guild improves, you gain influence over more people, including ones in greater positions of power. Orzhov Guild Spells Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature For you, the spells on the Orzhov Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.

Your spells might draw the blood of your enemies, or even directly touch their souls. Suggested Characteristics Members of the Orzhov Syndicate range from the decadent nobility at the top of the oligarchy to the debt-ridden wretches at the bottom. You fall somewhere between those extremes, so you might behave with the arrogance of the very rich or the humility of the impoverished. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I am always willing to act in accordance with the financial incentive offered. 2 Debts are never meant to be forgiven. 3 I am accustomed to enjoying the finest pleasures money can buy. 4 No one could doubt that I am a cut above the masses of pitiful peasants that infest the city. 5 I can’t stand to spend a zib more than necessary to purchase what I need. 6 I hate it when people try to make light of a serious situation. 7 I want to make sure everyone is aware of how wealthy, powerful, and important I am. 8 I can’t think of anything to look forward to. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any) 2 Wealth. I will do whatever it takes to become as rich as the oligarchs. (Evil) 3 Power. One day, I will be the one giving orders. (Evil) 4 Prestige. I want to be admired, respected, feared, or even hated for my position and wealth. (Evil) 5 Stability. The economy functions best when chaos is kept under control and everyone knows their place. (Lawful) 6 Eternity. I want to live forever—in the flesh as long as possible, and as a spirit afterward. (Any) Bonds d6 Bond 1 The unbearable weight of my debt has driven me to desperation. 2 I’m duty-bound to obey the dictates of an ancestor on the Ghost Council. 3 I value my worldly goods more highly than my mortal life. 4 An oligarch publicly humiliated me, and I will exact revenge on that whole family. 5 My faith in the Obzedat never wavers. 6 I want to prove myself more worthy than an older sibling and thereby ensure that I inherit a greater share of my parents’ wealth. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I hold a scandalous secret that could ruin my family forever—but could also earn me the favor of the Ghost Council. 2 I’m convinced that everyone I know is plotting against me. 3 I’ll brave any risk if the monetary reward is great enough. 4 I am convinced that I am far more important than anyone else is willing to acknowledge. 5 I have little respect for anyone who isn’t wealthy. 6 I’ll take any opportunity to steal from wealthier people, even for worthless trinkets."
Plaintiff,"Sure, accidents happen. But they seem to happen an awful lot when Acquisitions Incorporated operatives are on the scene. Naturally, nothing ever happens when there are no witnesses left behind. But sometimes one casualty is left a little less than dead, just waiting to discover what a lucky break that accident actually was. You were a victim of a legal incident that was ostensibly the fault of Acquisitions Incorporated. At least that’s what the local magistrate said. But before a final ruling could be handed down, Acquisitions Incorporated offered you a job! Don’t know how to swing a sword? They promised to teach you! Think you have what it takes to sling spells?

Even when the law is not on your side, you can use complex terms like ex injuria jus non oritur and cogitationis poenam nemo patitur to frighten people into thinking you know what you’re talking about. With common folks who don’t know any better, you might be able to intimidate or deceive to get favors or special treatment. Suggested Characteristics Plaintiffs come in many varieties. Some are innocent bystanders who want only fair compensation for their injuries. Others are professional courtroom operatives, going to extreme lengths to appear wronged in pursuit of a large payout. d8 Personality Trait 1 I can’t believe I have a chance to join Acquisitions Incorporated! The fun I’m going to have! 2 I’ve been wronged my entire life, and the world owes me. 3 I have always tried to make the best of a bad situation. 4 The law doesn’t protect the honest and the hard working. I’m going to do whatever needs to be done to make things right. 5 I’m always in the wrong place at the wrong time. 6 My superiors are smarter and wiser than I am.

We have each other’s backs. 6 My legal counsel is my best friend. I owe all my forthcoming opportunities to their hard work. d6 Flaw 1 The person who gains the most reward for the least effort wins. 2 Three magic beans for just one cow? What a deal! 3 I have only one vice, but it controls my life. 4 Sleep is for the weak. We need to keep training more if we’re going to be ready for the challenges ahead. 5 Until my songs are sung in every tavern in this realm, I won’t be satisfied. 6 If people find me unpleasant, that’s their problem."
Planar Philosopher,"A planar philosopher forges a portal key in the Great Foundry in Sigil, headquarters of the Mind's Eye. Prerequisite: Planescape Campaign You subscribe to a philosophy that seeks to understand the nature of the planes or some hidden truth of the multiverse. You draw strength from your conviction and, perhaps, a network of like-minded thinkers, such as the factions of Sigil (summarized below). In your travels, you explore the depths of your understanding and spread your philosophy wherever you go. Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, the skill associated with your faction (see the Sigil Faction Affinities table) or one skill of your choice Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: A portal key (such as a bag of golden tea leaves or the tooth of a planar beast), a manifesto of your guiding philosophy, a set of common clothes in your faction’s style, and a pouch containing 10 gp worth of coins from different worlds and planes Sigil Faction Affinities Faction Skill Athar Religion Bleak Cabal Insight Doomguard Nature Fated Intimidation Fraternity of Order History Hands of Havoc Stealth Harmonium Perception Heralds of Dust Medicine Mercykillers Survival Mind’s Eye Persuasion Society of Sensation Performance Transcendent Order Athletics Factions of Sigil Twelve factions have risen to prominence in the City of Doors, though many more exist. Your character might belong to one of these groups or another ideological faction, perhaps one of your own creation. The primary factions of Sigil, which are further detailed in chapter 2, adhere to the following philosophies: Athar. Deities are frauds and merely channel the might of a true, higher power. Bleak Cabal. There is no greater truth to the multiverse. Each being must discover their own meaning. Doomguard. Nothing lasts forever. The purpose of everything is to crumble and decay. Fated. Everyone makes their own fate and is entitled to whatever they can take and hold. Fraternity of Order. All of existence is governed by laws, and power comes from understanding and exploiting them. Hands of Havoc. Those who try to impose a single order on the multiverse are doomed to fail. Harmonium. The multiverse will be perfect only when everything is acting in harmony, whether it wants to or not. Heralds of Dust. Everyone is already dead; the entirety of the multiverse is an afterlife. Undeath holds the key to the next stage of existence. Mercykillers. Cold, relentless justice is absolute, and no one is above it. Mind’s Eye. The multiverse exists to be explored. It shapes us, and we shape it in turn. Society of Sensation. Sensation is the proof of existence. By experiencing everything, we can understand the multiverse in all its complexity. Transcendent Order. Thought clouds action. To fall in step with the multiverse, one must act on instinct alone. Creating Your Own Faction In Sigil, ideologies wax and wane over time, gaining popularity and drawing like-minded philosophers from one faction to another—the only constant in the City of Doors is the Lady of Pain herself. If you’d like to create and be part of your own faction, ask your DM about doing just that. Your faction should include the following details: A core philosophy centered on an assumption or fundamental truth about the multiverse or its workings A building that serves as the faction’s headquarters in the City of Doors A faction leader (called a factol) who embodies the faction’s beliefs Feature: Conviction You gain the Scion of the Outer Planes feat (presented later in this chapter). In addition, members of your organization provide you free, modest lodging and food at any of their holdings or the homes of other faction members. Building a Planar Philosopher Character Some groups of planar philosophers might prefer certain types of characters, but by and large any character who upholds and furthers the beliefs of such a group is welcome within its ranks. Suggested Characteristics. Adventurers who dedicate themselves to a particular philosophy regarding the multiverse are welcomed among factions that embrace those beliefs. The Planar Philosopher Personality Traits table suggests various traits you might adopt for your character. Planar Philosopher Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 I don’t venerate any gods. With time, we can be as powerful as them or greater. 2 Experience is everything; live in the moment. 3 When things crumble, I find meaning in the dust. 4 Life thrives through order, and I seek to maintain that order. 5 When others make plans, the multiverse laughs and so do I. 6 I know what’s right, and none will stand in my way. Planar Philosopher Trinkets. When you make your character, you can roll once on the Planar Philosopher Trinkets table, instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player’s Handbook , for your starting trinket. Planar Philosopher Trinkets d6 Trinket 1 Locket with a picture of my mentor and an inscription I can’t read 2 Bleached cranium rat skull with colored glass beads in its eye sockets 3 Torn parchment with half a rebus painted on it 4 Bracelet of twisted razorvine stems 5 Fragment of a bronze blade covered in verdigris 6 Broken holy symbol of a forgotten god"

(If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.) Prismari Spells Spell Level Spells 1st Chromatic Orb , Thunderwave 2nd Flaming Sphere , Kinetic Jaunt 3rd Haste , Water Walk 4th Freedom of Movement , Wall of Fire 5th Cone of Cold , Conjure Elemental Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. You might wield your Prismari spells with dynamic, gestural movement—as much dance as somatic component. Even a blast of fire in your hands is a sculpted work of art; elemental forces make grand designs as you hurl spells. These forces might linger on your body or in your clothes as decorative elements after your spells are dissipated, as sparks dance in your hair and your touch leaves tracings of frost on whatever you touch. Building a Prismari Character Any class or subclass that wields elemental forces of cold, fire, lightning, and wind can be a good fit in Prismari. Druids and sorcerers are common in Prismari, and wizards who study the Schools of Evocation or Transmutation are also well represented. Clerics aren’t very common in this school, but some with the Tempest domain end up here. Beyond the ranks of traditional spellcasters, Lorehold students also include monks who follow the Way of the Four Elements. Some acrobatic rogues and fighters (including those who emulate the archetype of the Eldritch Knight) also delight in the athleticism of Prismari performance. Suggested Characteristics. Though the curriculum of Prismari College attracts many outgoing and driven artists, the school has no shortage of shy scholars and lackadaisical blowhards among its ranks. The Prismari Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character. Prismari Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 I’m the life of the party, and I expect everyone’s attention when I walk into a room. 2 Two weeks ago, I was enthralled with my latest project. Now, I think it’s garbage and deserves to be destroyed. 3 I believe everyone has the ability to express their truest selves through art, and I’m happy to quietly push them in the right direction. 4 Everyone is a critic, and I work to win them all over. 5 I’m beset with such an overwhelming sense of ennui regarding my art. Nothing quite captures my attention anymore. 6 Instead of confronting my negative emotions, I channel them into explosive artistic displays. Prismari Trinkets. When you make your character, you may roll once on the Prismari Trinkets table, instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player’s Handbook , for your starting trinket. Prismari Trinkets d6 Trinket 1 A pair of rose-tinted glasses with glittery frames 2 A stoppered glass bottle that, when opened, plays a brassy orchestral piece 3 A quartet of hovering water motes in a vial 4 A bandolier of watercolor paints 5 A tiara capped with a crystal that crackles with harmless lightning 6 An iridescent quill"
Quandrix Student,"A Quandrix student magically gazes into the intricate patterns of nature. In preparation to become a student of Quandrix College, you have spent years working through the college’s math problems for prospective students. Your interests concentrate on the mathematical principles and patterns found in the natural world. You might lean more toward mathematics or physics, or you delve into more abstract studies of metaphysics, arcana, or logic. Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Nature Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A bottle of black ink, an ink pen, an abacus, a book of arcane theory, a school uniform, and a pouch containing 15 gp Feature: Quandrix Initiate You gain the Strixhaven Initiate feat and must choose Quandrix within it.

Quandrix Spells Spell Level Spells 1st Entangle , Guiding Bolt 2nd Enlarge/Reduce , Vortex Warp 3rd Aura of Vitality , Haste 4th Control Water , Freedom of Movement 5th Circle of Power , Passwall Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. Your Quandrix spells might manifest amid kaleidoscopic swirls of fractal patterns, amplifying the tiniest movements of your somatic components. When your magic creates or alters creatures, it might briefly surround the targets with shimmering fractal designs or tessellated patterns. Building a Quandrix Character Any spellcasting class or subclass can work well for a Quandrix character. Both the scholarly focus of wizards (especially those who study the Schools of Abjuration, Illusion, or Transmutation) and the metamagic manipulations of sorcerers are welcome in Quandrix, and many druids explore the patterns of nature in Quandrix as well. A few clerics, particularly those with the Knowledge or Nature domains, study in Quandrix as well. Aside from traditional spellcasters, a few characters of other classes find homes in Quandrix. Some fighters, monks, rangers, and rogues study here, using Quandrix principles to train their minds. Suggested Characteristics. With subjects ranging from the physical and tangible to the paradoxical and strange, the student body of Quandrix College includes an eclectic mix of individuals. The Quandrix Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character. Quandrix Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 When I find a subject I’m interested in, I won’t stop studying until I know everything about it. It keeps me up at night. 2 I hope this all makes sense to me one day. Until then, I’m going to keep faking it. 3 Equations and patterns come naturally to my mind. I wish friendship came just as easily. 4 I believe I’m always the smartest person in the room. And I’ll prove it, even if no one asks me to. 5 If these classes have taught me anything, it’s that reality is a lie, and nothing matters. So why bother? 6 Before I graduate, I want to achieve something mathematically impossible. I must leave a legacy! Quandrix Trinkets.

Rakdos Cultist,"You’re an entertainer at heart, a performer with a flair for the dramatic and a love of the spotlight. You’ve spent years honing your craft, mastering a demanding set of skills so you can perform them with panache and make them look easy. The wild applause, the screams of the crowds, the mayhem and terror spreading into the streets—this is what you live for. You’re also a member of a cult devoted to an ancient demon who delights in violence and chaos. It just so happens that Rakdos loves a good show, and your highest aspiration is to please the Defiler, the Lord of Riots, with your own performance. Skill Proficiencies: Acrobatics, Performance Languages: Choose either Abyssal or Giant Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument Equipment: A Rakdos insignia, a musical instrument (one of your choice), a costume, a hooded lantern made of wrought iron, a 10-foot length of chain with sharply spiked links, a tinderbox, 10 torches, a set of common clothes, a belt pouch containing 10 gp (a mix of Azorius and Boros 1-zino coins), and a bottle of sweet, red juice A Flair for the Dramatic Rakdos performance styles typically fuse standard circus-style acrobatics with fire, wrought-iron spikes and hooks, and monsters. You can roll a d8 or choose from the options in the Performance Options table to determine your preferred style of performance. Performance Options d8 Type of Performer 1 Spikewheel acrobat 2 Lampooning artist 3 Fire juggler 4 Marionette puppeteer 5 Pain artist 6 Noise musician 7 Nightmare clown 8 Master of ceremonies Feature: Fearsome Reputation People recognize you as a member of the Cult of Rakdos , and they’re careful not to draw your anger or ridicule. You can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a restaurant or breaking down a door at a local shop, if no legal authorities witness the crime. Most people are too daunted by you to report your wrongdoing to the Azorius . Rakdos Guild Spells Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature For you, the spells on the Rakdos Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.) Rakdos Guild Spells Spell Level Spells Cantrip fire bolt, vicious mockery 1st burning hands, dissonant whispers, hellish rebuke 2nd crown of madness, enthrall, flaming sphere 3rd fear, haste 4th confusion, wall of fire 5th dominate person Your magic often produces a flashy spectacle, wreathing you or your targets in a mixture of harmless flame and shadowy shapes. When you manipulate an opponent’s mind, a flaming symbol of Rakdos might momentarily appear like a mask over the target’s face. Suggested Characteristics Members of demonic cults aren’t generally known as the kindest or most mentally stable individuals, so you’re likely to have something in your nature that distinguishes you from the law-abiding citizens of Ravnica. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I revel in mayhem, the more destructive the better. 2 When violence breaks out, I lose myself in rage, and it’s sometimes hard to stop. 3 Everything is funny to me, and the most hilarious and bloodiest things leave me cackling with sadistic glee. 4 I derive genuine pleasure from the pain of others. 5 I enjoy testing other people’s patience. 6 I can’t stand it when things are predictable, so I like to add a little chaos to every situation. 7 I throw my weight around to make sure I get my way. 8 I enjoy breaking delicate works of art. And fingers, which are sort of the same. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any) 2 Hedonism. Death comes for everyone, so take as much pleasure as you can from every moment of life. (Neutral) 3 Creativity. I strive to find more ways to express my art through pain—my own as well as others’. (Chaotic) 4 Freedom. No one tells me what to do. (Chaotic) 5 Equality. I want to see Ravnica remade, with no guilds and no hierarchies. (Chaotic) 6 Spectacle. People are inspired by the greatness they see in art. (Any) Bonds d6 Bond 1 I have belonged to the same performance troupe for years, and these people mean everything to me. 2 A blood witch told me I have a special destiny to fulfill, and I’m trying to figure out what it is. 3 I’m secretly hoping that I can change the cult from the inside, using my influence to help rein in the wanton violence. 4 I own something that Rakdos once touched (it’s seared black at the spot), and I cherish it. 5 I want to be better at my chosen form of performance than any other member of my troupe. 6 I am devoted to Rakdos and live to impress him. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 My family is prominent in another guild. I enjoy my wild life, but I don’t want to embarrass them. 2 I couldn’t hide my emotions and opinions even if I wanted to. 3 I throw caution to the wind. 4 I resent the rich and powerful. 5 When I’m angry, I lash out in violence. 6 There’s no such thing as too much pleasure."
Rewarded,"You were living a difficult life before your destiny suddenly changed through a miraculous turn of good fortune. Perhaps a benevolent deity gave you precisely what you most desired. You might have stumbled across a Deck of Many Things and drawn a card with a potent, positive effect. Or maybe you inherited a modest fortune from a distant relative you didn’t know you had. Regardless, you left the daily miseries of your old life behind in favor of a life of adventure and excitement. Your old debts have been paid, responsibilities you thought inescapable are behind you, or you suddenly possess rare and unusual skills unknown to ordinary folk. Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Persuasion Languages: One of your choice Tool Proficiencies: One gaming set of your choice (such as playing cards or three-dragon ante cards) Equipment: A bottle of black ink, an ink pen, five sheets of paper, a gaming set (matching your chosen proficiency), a signet ring, a set of fine clothes, and a pouch containing 18 gp Feature: Fortune’s Favor Your unexpected good fortune is reflected by a minor boon. You gain the Lucky, Magic Initiate, or Skilled feat (your choice). Your choice of feat reflects the transformation that changed your life. An encounter with a genie who gave you three wishes might have resulted in magical powers represented by Magic Initiate. If you paid off all your family debts with a fortuitous round of three-dragon ante, you might be Lucky instead. Alternatively, you could use the Skilled feat to reflect whatever trial you endured to secure your new destiny and to model the knowledge and abilities imparted to you by whatever force transformed your life. Building a Rewarded Character Rewarded characters have varied histories, but they have one thing in common: they were down on their luck before their lives abruptly turned around. They might have given up all hope of a happier life, only to suddenly get a second chance. A rewarded character has often spent many years struggling to escape painful circumstances. Now, extricated from the (sometimes literal) prison that was their former life, they throw their cares to the wind and become adventurers. If your character’s life was changed by a Deck of Many Things , consider which card was responsible. Perhaps the Fates card undid a tragic mistake your character made in their youth. The Gem card could have wiped out debts incurred over a lifetime. Maybe the Sage card provided the advice needed to escape a hopeless situation, the Star card increased an ability score to its current value, or a Wish spell cast after drawing the Moon card transformed your character from a peddler to a fledgling sorcerer infused with magic and new knowledge and skills. If you’re making a character at higher than 1st level, magic items they have could have been granted by the Key or Sun card. Suggested Characteristics. Your character’s perspective on life has changed thanks to their new destiny. The Rewarded Personality Traits table suggests traits you might adopt for your character and cards from the Deck of Many Things that might have prompted this trait. Rewarded Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 A safe home is a foundation on which anything else can be built. (Key, Throne) 2 I was elevated to heights I could never otherwise attain, and I won’t waste my fortune. (Star, Sun) 3 I try to be a source of inspiration and joy to others. Life is never as bad as you think! (Euryale, Jester) 4 Courage and boldness can carry the day when all else fails. (Comet, Knight) 5 My good fortune means I can lift others up as well. (Gem, Moon) 6 Having the right answers is the first step to solving any problem, no matter how dire. (Fates, Sage) Rewarded Trinkets. When you make your character, you can roll once on the Rewarded Trinkets table instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player’s Handbook for your starting trinket. Rewarded Trinkets d6 Trinket 1 A perfumed silk scarf from an admirer 2 A crystal bead that glows like a candle in the dark 3 A letter of introduction and invitation from an influential person in a far-off city 4 A motto or symbol whose meaning eludes you, etched on a piece of your equipment 5 A crisp playing card that never seems to tear or soil, depicting the card that affected you 6 Half a medallion designed to be rejoined to its other half"
Rival Intern,"You were an intern at a rival of Acquisitions Incorporated, and you gained a healthy respect for not just the job and the franchising opportunities, but for the ruthless and efficient way Acquisitions Incorporated goes about its business. Why deal with the rest, when you can work for the best? Perhaps the rival did not treat you as well as you were hoping, or you washed out of that organization. Maybe you hope to leverage the knowledge you gained there for an advantage at Acquisitions Incorporated. Either way, you’re now bringing your talents to the company, ready to put your skills to use. Skill Proficiency: History, Investigation Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools Languages: Any one of your choice Equipment: One set of artisan’s tools, a ledger from your previous employer containing a small piece of useful information, a set of fine clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Inside Informant You have connections to your previous employer or other groups you dealt with during your previous employment. You can communicate with your contacts, gaining information at the DM’s discretion. Suggested Characteristics If you were happy with your previous internship, the parting of ways might have been amicable. If not, it might have involved armed guards removing you from the premises. If you were passed over at your previous position, it might have left you a blend of seething rage, practiced nonchalance, and keen knowledge of where the bodies are buried (perhaps literally). d8 Personality Trait 1 My previous employer didn’t respect me, and now I’ll do whatever I can to gain respect. 2 The job is important, but the relationships I forge with my coworkers are even more so. 3 The job is everything to me. Who needs relaxation, hobbies, and a social life? 4 I know I’m not the best and brightest, but if I put my best self forward, I can overcome anything. 5 My former boss was an idiot. So was my boss before that. And before that. I’m sure those were all coincidences. 6 This company is so much better than my previous one. It will always be the best until they stop paying me. 7 I know this dagger belongs to the company, but I’m sure they won’t miss it. Or this flask. Or this armor. 8 It’s only a matter of time before I’ll be upper management. I just have to kiss up to my superiors and kick down those beneath me. d6 Ideal 1 Advancement. Money and power can be gained more easily within an organization. I plan to gain as much as possible. (Evil) 2 Structure. Life goes much more smoothly when you follow the rules and work within a system. (Lawful) 3 Uncertainty. The more chaos that swirls around me, the more opportunities I can find to profit. (Chaotic) 4 Justice. I can’t stand people being treated unjustly. I do whatever it takes to stop injustice and those who flout the law. (Lawful) 5 Pleasure. What’s the use of working hard and making money if you can’t enjoy the finer things in life? (Any) 6 Power. Money is fine, but real power means never having to say you’re sorry. (Evil) d6 Bond 1 I have a family member in need. I consider them in everything I do. 2 My peers keep me grounded. 3 My past mistakes cost someone else dearly. I have to rectify that. 4 A childhood mentor put me on my current path. If I succeed, I want to repay that mentor in some way. 5 I value an oath of loyalty I took to a group of friends over everything else in my life. 6 Although I don’t get along well with people, my pet means the world to me. d6 Flaw 1 I know what’s best. Trust me. 2 Flaw? I have no flaws. I’m perfect. 3 My loyalties are … fluid. 4 If anything goes wrong, it must be someone else’s fault. Let me explain that in detail. 5 There’s right and there’s wrong, and there’s no gray area in between. 6 Our superiors might not like what you’re doing. I’m going to have to put that in my report."
Ruined,"Everything was going so well! You had a life of luxury, love, and comfort when you suddenly lost it all. Perhaps you were framed for crimes you didn’t commit and lost your reputation, fortune, and career. Maybe a rampaging dragon or another monster wiped out everything you had in a single calamitous afternoon. Or you might have sought out a Deck of Many Things , hoping to make your successful life even more glorious—only to draw a destructive card that changed your destiny forever. Your desperation has driven you to the career of adventurer. You don’t seek out dark dungeons and their monstrous inhabitants for excitement and glory; you do it because every other path is closed to you. But you have risen high on fortune’s wheel once before, and with luck and fortitude, you could do so again. Skill Proficiencies: Stealth, Survival Languages: One of your choice Tool Proficiencies: One gaming set of your choice (such as playing cards or three-dragon ante cards) Equipment: A cracked hourglass, a set of rusty manacles, a half-empty bottle, a hunting trap, a gaming set (matching your chosen proficiency), a set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 13 gp Feature: Still Standing You have weathered ruinous misfortune, and you possess hidden reserves others don’t expect. You gain the Alert, Skilled, or Tough feat (your choice). Your choice of feat reflects how you’ve dealt with the terrible loss that changed your life forever. If you’ve kept your senses sharp for every opportunity and climbed your way out of misery by seizing the tiniest scrap of hope, choose Alert. If you’ve redoubled your efforts to reclaim what was once yours, choose Skilled. If you’ve stoically persevered through your misfortune, select Tough. Building a Ruined Character Ruined characters were on top of the world before misfortune struck. Many were wealthy. Others come from modest backgrounds, but they were surrounded by friends, family, and loved ones. They might have been famous, or simply never encountered serious hardship before. Some were born to privilege or rose to prominence through trickery or a false reputation. Now a Deck of Many Things —or another calamity—has knocked them down like a house of cards. If your character’s life was ruined by a Deck of Many Things , consider which card was responsible. Perhaps your character was imprisoned for years by the Donjon or Void card, and now everyone they knew has died. Maybe your character drew the Rogue card, and the person closest to them—a spouse, child, or parent—turned against them. A devil unleashed by the Flames card might have destroyed their life. The Ruin or Talons card might have stolen the character’s material goods or saddled them with vast debt. Suggested Characteristics. Rising above misfortune shapes one’s perspective. The Ruined Personality Traits table suggests traits you might adopt for your character (and ruinous cards that might have prompted this trait). Ruined Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 I’ve changed from my past, and I work to live up to my new path. (Balance, Throne) 2 Every moment is a gift I refuse to squander. (Euryale, Skull) 3 Now that I’ve overcome having nothing, I can survive anything. (Fool, Ruin, Talons) 4 I know enemies are set against me, and I always prepare for the worst. (Flames, Rogue) 5 I interpret every event as part of a larger pattern I just haven’t worked out yet. (Puzzle, Star) 6 I must make up for so much time I’ve already lost. (Donjon, Void) Ruined Trinkets. When you make your character, you can roll once on the Ruined Trinkets table instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player’s Handbook .

Rune Carver,"What we call rune magic is the palest imitation of Annam's creative work. He shaped worlds from the primal elements; we struggle to bind the merest scraps of elemental power into the mystic shapes of our runes. —Diancastra You’ve dedicated your life to studying runecraft. Whether you were taught by a master rune carver or learned by poring over ancient engravings, you can tap into the supernatural power held within runes. The art of runecraft was initially created by giants, but over time, the practice has been adopted by many peoples. As such, though Giant runes are the most commonly used, many rune carvers incorporate symbols from their native languages into the craft. Skill Proficiencies: History, Perception Tool Proficiencies: One set of artisan’s tools Langua ges: Giant Equipment: A set of artisan’s tools (one of your choice), a small knife, a whetstone, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp Rune Styles Each rune carver has a unique style and preferred medium. To determine how you make your runes, you can roll on the Rune Style table. Rune Style d6 Style 1 You inscribe runes in wax or clay with a fine metal needle. 2 You whittle pieces of wood into small figurines you mark with runes. 3 You engrave runes onto glass beads and thread them onto necklaces and bracelets. 4 You stitch runes into the hems of clothing. 5 You carve runes on a set of animal bones you can throw in different formations. 6 You draw runes into candles, melting the wax to smooth over the engravings. Feature: Rune Shaper You gain the Rune Shaper feat. Building a Rune Carver Character Scholarly pursuits, ancient mysteries, or a fateful encounter might inspire a character to pursue the secrets of a rune carver. Suggested Characteristics. The Rune Carver Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character. Rune Carver Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 Is it practical to learn an ancient language that is rarely spoken? No. But is it fun? Very. 2 I learned one of my ancestors was a lauded rune carver whose story was lost to time. I seek to rekindle that legacy. 3 The old, traditional markings of runecraft look so boring. Why not give my runes some flair? 4 In my studies of runes, I strive to understand how great civilizations of the past fell, so I can prevent it from happening to societies of the present. 5 Life may be a whirlwind of chaos, but whenever I create my runes, I feel at peace. 6 My brain struggles to process words written in ink, but the feeling of carved runes makes my mind sing."
Sage,"You spent years learning the lore of the multiverse. You scoured manuscripts, studied scrolls, and listened to the greatest experts on the subjects that interest you. Your efforts have made you a master in your fields of study. Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, History Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: A bottle of black ink, a quill, a small knife, a letter from a dead colleague posing a question you have not yet been able to answer, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp Specialty To determine the nature of your scholarly training, roll a d8 or choose from the options in the table below. d8 Specialty d8 Specialty 1 Alchemist 5 Professor 2 Astronomer 6 Researcher 3 Discredited academic 7 Wizard's apprentice 4 Librarian 8 Scribe Feature: Researcher When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a libr⁠ary, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign. Suggested Characteristics Sages are defined by their extensive studies, and their characteristics reflect this life of study. Devoted to scholarly pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly—sometimes in its own right, sometimes as a means toward other ideals. d8 Personality Trait 1 I use polysyllabic words that convey the impression of great erudition. 2 I’ve read every book in the world’s greatest libraries—or I like to boast that I have. 3 I’m used to helping out those who aren’t as smart as I am, and I patiently explain anything and everything to others. 4 There’s nothing I like more than a good mystery. 5 I’m willing to listen to every side of an argument before I make my own judgment. 6 I . . . speak . . . slowly . . . when talking . . . to idiots, . . . which . . . almost . . . everyone . . . is . . . compared . . . to me. 7 I am horribly, horribly awkward in social situations. 8 I’m convinced that people are always trying to steal my secrets. d6 Ideal 1 Knowledge.

Emotions must not cloud our logical thinking. (Lawful) 4 No Limits. Nothing should fetter the infinite possibility inherent in all existence. (Chaotic) 5 Power. Knowledge is the path to power and domination. (Evil) 6 Self-Improvement. The goal of a life of study is the betterment of oneself.

I hope to do great deeds and win it back. d6 Flaw 1 I am easily distracted by the promise of information. 2 Most people scream and run when they see a demon. I stop and take notes on its anatomy. 3 Unlocking an ancient mystery is worth the price of a civilization. 4 I overlook obvious solutions in favor of complicated ones. 5 I speak without really thinking through my words, invariably insulting others. 6 I can’t keep a secret to save my life, or anyone else’s."

Above all, you have a careful attention to detail, helping you avoid introducing mistakes to the documents you copy and create."
Selesnya Initiate,"You are a member of a blessed community, built on the ideals of harmony. Here, nature and civilization coexist peacefully, living and growing in accordance with the will of the Worldsoul, Mat’Selesnya. As a member of the Selesnya Conclave, you are surrounded by people and other creatures who share your worldview and your longing for deeper spiritual communion with the world, and you have a fervent desire to share the joy you have experienced with Ravnica. Along with the rest of the conclave, you are committed to resisting the ambitions of the other guilds—with military force if necessary. Skill Proficiencies: Nature, Persuasion Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument Languages: Choose one of Elvish, Loxodon, or Sylvan Equipment: A Selesnya insignia, a healer’s kit, robes, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp ( Azorius 1-zino coins) Feature: Conclave’s Shelter As a member of the Selesnya Conclave , you can count on your guild mates to provide shelter and aid. You and your companions can find a place to hide or rest in any Selesnya enclave in the city, unless you have proven to be a danger to them. The members of the enclave will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives in this effort. In addition, as a guild member you can receive free healing and care at a Selesnya enclave, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Selesnya Guild Spells Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature For you, the spells on the Selesnya Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.

A sensation of gentle warmth and the smell of spring flowers or autumn leaves might accompany your spells. Suggested Characteristics Most members of the Selesnya Conclave are true believers—the tight-knit community allows little room for the cynical or disillusioned. They are spiritual, empathetic, and generally peaceful—unless roused to action. Their flaws and bonds alike grow naturally from their close ties to the community. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I never raise my voice or lose my temper. 2 I feel the pains and joys of everyone around me, friend or foe. 3 I would rather make a friend than thwart an enemy. 4 I’m always straining to peer into another reality that seems to be just beyond my senses. 5 I’m uneasy if I can’t see plants growing or feel soil beneath my feet. 6 Seeing illness or injury in any creature saddens me. 7 I have much to be proud of, but I am still just one strand in the grand, interwoven tapestry of life. 8 Nature offers rich and abundant metaphors for understanding the complexities of life. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any) 2 Harmony. Nothing is more beautiful than voices and actions aligned in common purpose. (Good) 3 Order. Like a well-pruned tree, society thrives when everything is kept in good order. (Lawful) 4 Life. Preserving life and nature is always a worthwhile endeavor. (Good) 5 Humility. Ambition and pride are the roots of strife. (Good) 6 Evangelism. When all have joined the Selesnya Conclave , Ravnica will finally know peace. (Any) Bonds d6 Bond 1 I would give my life in the defense of the small enclave where I first encountered Mat’Selesnya. 2 I love beasts and plants of all kinds, and am loath to harm them. 3 A healer nursed me to recovery from a mortal illness. 4 I’ll sing the invitation of Mat’Selesnya with my dying breath. 5 I cherish a leaf from Vitu-Ghazi that changes color with the seasons, even though it is no longer attached to the tree. 6 Every member of the conclave is my kin, and I would fight for any one of them. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I’m terrified of getting into a fight where my side is outnumbered. 2 I assume that people mean well until they prove otherwise. 3 I enjoy comfort and quiet, and prefer to avoid extra effort. 4 I have a fierce temper that doesn’t reflect the inner calm I seek. 5 I’m convinced that everyone else in the conclave has a deeper connection to the Worldsoul than I do. 6 I’m trying to atone for the life of crime I led before I joined the Selesnya , but I find it hard to give up my bad habits."
Shipwright,"Shipwright You have sailed into war on the decks of great ships, patching their hulls with soup bowls and prayers. You once helped build a fishing vessel that single-handedly saved a town from starvation. You have seen a majestic prow in your dreams that you have not been able to replicate in wood. Since childhood, you have loved the water and have been captivated by the many vessels that travel on it. Skill Proficiencies: History, Perception Tool Proficiencies: Carpenter’s tools, vehicles (water) Equipment: A set of well-loved carpenter’s tools, a blank book, 1 ounce of ink, an ink pen, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a leather pouch with 10 gp Feature: I’ll Patch It! Provided you have carpenter’s tools and wood, you can perform repairs on a water vehicle. When you use this ability, you restore a number of hit points to the hull of a water vehicle equal to 5 × your proficiency modifier. A vehicle cannot be patched by you in this way again until after it has been pulled ashore and fully repaired. Life at Sea Your life at sea and in port has shaped you; you can roll on the following table to determine its impact or choose an element that best fits your character. d6 Influence 1 Grand Designs. You are working on plans and schematics for a new, very fast ship. You must examine as many different kinds of vessels as possible to help ensure the success of your design. 2 Solid and Sound. You patched up a war galley and prevented it from sinking. The local navy regards you as a friend. 3 Favored. You insisted on thicker planking for a merchant vessel’s hull, which saved it from sinking when it smashed against a reef. You have a standing invitation to visit the merchant’s distant mansion. 4 Master of Armaments. You specialized in designing and mounting defenses for the navy. You easily recognize and determine the quality of such items. 5 Low Places. You have contacts in the smuggling outfits along the coast; you occasionally repair the criminals’ ships in exchange for coin and favors. 6 Mysteries of the Deep. You experienced an encounter with a possibly divine being while sailing alone. Work with your DM to determine the secret about the deep waters of the sea that this entity revealed to you. Suggested Characteristics Shipwrights are resourceful carpenters and designers. They often have a dedicated spot at the local tavern, since shipwrights are invaluable to coastal communities. Some travel with naval fleets and might serve as officers if their temperament suits it. Shipwrights have an affinity for working with their hands and often perform feats of carpentry that others might deem miraculous. Shipwright Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I love talking and being heard more than I like to listen. 2 I’m extremely fond of puzzles. 3 I thrive under pressure. 4 I love sketching and designing objects, especially boats. 5 I’m not afraid of hard work—in fact, I prefer it. 6 A pipe, an ale, and the smell of the sea: paradise. 7 I have an endless supply of cautionary tales related to the sea. 8 I don’t mind getting my hands dirty.

(Any) Shipwright Bonds d6 Bond 1 I must visit all the oceans of the world and behold the ships that sail there. 2 Much of the treasure I claim will be used to enrich my community. 3 I must find a kind of wood rumored to possess magical qualities. 4 I repair broken things to redeem what’s broken in myself. 5 I will craft a boat capable of sailing through the most dangerous of storms. 6 A kraken destroyed my masterpiece; its teeth shall adorn my hearth. Shipwright Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I don’t know when to throw something away. You never know when it might be useful again. 2 I get frustrated to the point of distraction by shoddy craftsmanship. 3 Though I am an excellent crafter, my work tends to look as though it belongs on a ship. 4 I am so obsessed with sketching my ideas for elaborate inventions that I sometimes forget little thing like eating and sleeping. 5 I’m judgmental of those who are not skilled with tools of some kind. 6 I sometimes take things that don’t belong to me, especially if they are very well made.

Silverquill Student,"You have spent years practicing your writing and oration in the hope of becoming a student of Silverquill College. Your studies focus on language, literature, and the power of words, both magical and otherwise. The metaphorical power of words to illuminate or conceal is joined with the literal ability of magic to do the same in your academic pursuits. Skill Proficiencies: Intimidation, Persuasion Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: A bottle of black ink, an ink pen, a book of poetry, a school uniform, and a pouch containing 15 gp Feature: Silverquill Initiate You gain the Strixhaven Initiate feat and must choose Silverquill within it. In addition, if you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, the spells on the Silverquill Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.) Silverquill Spells Spell Level Spells 1st Dissonant Whispers , Silvery Barbs 2nd Calm Emotions , Darkness 3rd Beacon of Hope , Daylight 4th Compulsion , Confusion 5th Dominate Person , Rary’s Telepathic Bond Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. Your Silverquill spells might be accompanied by visual effects resembling splotches of ink or radiating ripples of golden light. Any auditory effects of your spells often sound like amplified echoes of your own voice speaking the spells’ verbal components—even amid the crash of lightning or a fiery eruption. Building a Silverquill Character Many bards find a home in Silverquill, putting the power of their voices to use with Silverquill magic. Wizards (especially those who study the Schools of Illusion and Enchantment) are common in Silverquill, as are warlocks. Clerics with the Divine Domains of Light and Trickery also fit in well among the mages of Silverquill. A number of both paladins and rogues attend Silverquill College as well, highlighting the diversity of the student body. Suggested Characteristics. With the college’s intense standards looming over them, Silverquill students range from cocky and cutthroat to overwhelmed perfectionists. The Silverquill Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character. Silverquill Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 I’ll say whatever I need to in order to maintain my high social status. 2 I prefer saying the blunt truth over a pretty lie, and I don’t particularly care whose feelings I hurt. 3 I believe that uplifting my peers is the best way to succeed. 4 I’ve mastered the art of using humor as a defense, and I always have a charming joke ready. 5 I always wait before speaking, analyzing the situation for whichever angle is most advantageous to my goals. 6 No one knows about the all-nighters I’ve pulled to keep my magic looking effortless, and I’m going to keep it that way. Silverquill Trinkets. When you make your character, you may roll once on the Silverquill Trinkets table, instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player’s Handbook , for your starting trinket. Silverquill Trinkets d6 Trinket 1 A black leather notebook filled with half-finished poems 2 A set of flashcards detailing different colloquialisms and their meanings 3 A canteen that makes any liquid drunk from it taste sweet 4 A forged permission slip granting access to the special archives of Strixhaven’s libraries 5 A stylish silver pin that references a famous series of novels about warlocks 6 A stack of small pieces of parchment, each enchanted to stick to whatever surface it’s pressed against and peel off easily"
Simic Scientist,"Imagine a perfect world: one in which nature and civilization exist in harmony, adapted to each other; one in which life is shaped to match its environment and the environment is shaped to match life. That’s the world you have been trying to grow in the laboratories of the Simic Combine . Nature is all about adaptation, evolution, and balance—but for it to keep up with the pace of advancing civilization, nature needs some help from biomancers and terraformers. If, along the way, you happen to create super-soldiers and mutant monsters that can bolster the combine’s defenses against the schemes and ambitions of the other guilds, so much the better. Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Medicine Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: A Simic insignia, a set of commoner’s clothes, a book of research notes, an ink pen, a bottle of squid ink, a flask of oil (made from blubber), a vial of acid (derived from digestive juices), a vial of fish scales, a vial of seaweed, a vial of jellyfish stingers, a glass bottle of unidentified slime, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins) Clades and Projects As a Simic researcher, you are part of a clade—a diverse group of individuals combining disparate talents in pursuit of a common goal—or a researcher on a specialized, short-term project focused on addressing an immediate need. You can roll a d6 or choose from the options in the Research Options table to determine your area of research. Research Options d6 Clade/Project 1 Hull Clade, focused on protection and durability 2 Fin Clade, focused on movement 3 Gyre Clade, focused on cyclical patterns and metamagic 4 Guardian Project, focused on creating guard monsters and super soldiers 5 Crypsis Project, focused on intelligence and counterintelligence 6 Independent research in a new area Feature: Researcher When you attempt to learn or recall a magical or scientific fact, if you don’t know that information, you know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a Simic laboratory, or sometimes from an Izzet facility, a library, a university, or an independent scholar or other learned person or creature. Knowing where the information can be found doesn’t automatically enable you to learn it; you might need to offer bribes, favors, or other incentives to induce people to reveal their secrets. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an inaccessible place, or that it simply can’t be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign. Simic Guild Spells Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature For you, the spells on the Simic Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.) Simic Guild Spells Spell Level Spells Cantrip acid splash, druidcraft 1st detect poison and disease, expeditious retreat, jump 2nd alter self, enhance ability, enlarge/reduce 3rd gaseous form, water breathing, wind wall 4th freedom of movement, polymorph 5th creation When your magic causes physical alterations in yourself or others, the result often displays the characteristics of fish, amphibians, or other water-dwelling creatures. Blue-green eddies of magical energy sometimes accompany your spellcasting, forming spirals that reflect the mathematical perfection of nature. Suggested Characteristics The bizarre science of the Simic Combine attracts a certain type of personality and encompasses a set of beliefs about the nature of life. Simic members’ bonds and flaws derive from their scientific research—including their creation of new life forms, which they can become very attached to. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I can’t wait to see what I become next! 2 I am convinced that everything inclines toward constant improvement. 3 I’m eager to explain every detail of my most intricate experiments and theories to anyone who shows the least bit of interest. 4 I assume that everyone needs even the most basic concepts explained to them. 5 I describe everything that happens as if it were going into my research notes (and it often is). 6 I am insatiably curious about the seemingly infinite forms and adaptations of life. 7 I can’t resist prying into anything forbidden, since it must be terribly interesting. 8 I employ a highly technical vocabulary to avoid imprecision and ambiguity in my communication. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any) 2 Change. All life is meant to progress toward perfection, and our work is to hurry it along—no matter what must be upended along the way. (Chaotic) 3 Knowledge. Understanding the world is more important than what you do with your knowledge. (Neutral) 4 Greater Good. I want to reshape the world into higher forms of life so that all can enjoy evolution. (Good) 5 Logic. It’s foolish to let emotions and principles interfere with the conclusions of logic. (Lawful) 6 Superiority. My vast intellect and strength are directed toward increasing my sway over others. (Evil) Bonds d6 Bond 1 I helped create a krasis that I love like a pet and would carry with me everywhere … except it’s the size of a building, and it might eat me. 2 In my laboratory, I discovered something that I think could eliminate half the life on Ravnica. 3 The other researchers in my clade are my family—a big, eccentric family including members and parts of many species. 4 The laboratory where I did my research contains everything that is precious to me. 5 I will get revenge on the shortsighted fool who killed my precious krasis creation. 6 Everything I do is an attempt to impress someone I love. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I have a rather embarrassing mutation that I do everything I can to keep hidden. 2 I’m more interested in taking notes on monstrous anatomy than in fighting monsters. 3 Every social situation I’m in seems to lead to my asking rude personal questions. 4 I’m supremely confident in my ability to adapt to any situation and handle any danger. 5 I’ll take any risk to earn recognition for my scientific brilliance. 6 I have a tendency to take shortcuts in my research and any other tasks I have to complete."
Smuggler,"Smuggler On a rickety barge, you carried a hundred longswords in fish barrels right past the dock master’s oblivious lackeys. You have paddled a riverboat filled with stolen elven wine under the gaze of the moon and sold it for twice its value in the morning. In your more charitable times, you have transported innocents out of war zones or helped guide herd animals to safety on the banks of a burning river. Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Deception Tool Proficiencies: Vehicles (water) Equipment: A fancy leather vest or a pair of leather boots, a set of common clothes, and a leather pouch with 15 gp Feature: Down Low You are acquainted with a network of smugglers who are willing to help you out of tight situations. While in a particular town, city, or other similarly sized community (DM’s discretion), you and your companions can stay for free in safe houses. Safe houses provide a poor lifestyle. While staying at a safe house, you can choose to keep your presence (and that of your companions) a secret. Claim to Fame Every smuggler has that one tale that sets them apart from common criminals. By wits, sailing skill, or a silver tongue, you lived to tell the story—and you tell it often. You can roll on the following table to determine your claim or choose one that best fits your character. d6 Accomplishment 1 Spirit of the Whale. You smuggled stolen dwarven spirits in the body of a dead whale being pulled behind a fishing boat. When you delivered the goods, the corpse suddenly exploded, sending whale meat and whiskey bottles for half a mile. 2 Cart and Sword. You drove a cart filled with stolen art through the middle of a battlefield while singing sea shanties to confuse the combatants. 3 The Recruit. You enlisted in another nation’s navy for the purpose of smuggling stolen jewels to a distant port. You attained a minor rank before disappearing from the navy and making your way here. 4 River of Shadows. Your riverboat accidentally slipped through the veil into the Shadowfell for several hours. While you were there, you sold some stolen dragonborn artifacts before returning to this plane and paddling home. 5 Gold-Hearted. You agreed to transport a family escaping a war. The baby began to cry at a checkpoint, and you gave the guards all your gold to let you pass. The family never found out about this gesture. 6 Playing Both Sides. You once smuggled crates of crossbow bolts and bundles of arrows, each destined for an opposing side in a regional war, at the same time. The buyers arrived within moments of each other but did not discover your trickery. Suggested Characteristics In general, smugglers value survival, and then profit, above other things. One could be a part of a larger organization, or might run a small smuggling vessel of their own. Smugglers live the lies they have told, and they have a natural ability to recall all the falsehoods and half-truths they have ever spouted. Smuggler Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I love being on the water but hate fishing. 2 I think of everything in terms of monetary value. 3 I never stop smiling. 4 Nothing rattles me; I have a lie for every occasion. 5 I love gold but won’t cheat a friend. 6 I enjoy doing things others believe to be impossible. 7 I become wistful when I see the sun rise over the ocean. 8 I am no common criminal; I am a mastermind. Smuggler Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Wealth. Heaps of coins in a secure vault is all I dream of. (Any) 2 Smuggler’s Code. I uphold the unwritten rules of the smugglers, who do not cheat one another or directly harm innocents. (Lawful) 3 All for a Coin. I’ll do nearly anything if it means I turn a profit. (Evil) 4 Peace and Prosperity. I smuggle only to achieve a greater goal that benefits my community. (Good) 5 People. For all my many lies, I place a high value on friendship. (Any) 6 Daring. I am most happy when risking everything. (Any) Smuggler Bonds d6 Bond 1 My vessel was stolen from me, and I burn with the desire to recover it. 2 I intend to become the leader of the network of smugglers that I belong to. 3 I owe a debt that cannot be repaid in gold. 4 After one last job, I will retire from the business. 5 I was tricked by a fellow smuggler who stole something precious from me. I will find that thief. 6 I give most of my profits to a charitable cause, and I don’t like to brag about it. Smuggler Flaws d6 Flaw 1 Lying is reflexive, and I sometimes engage in it without realizing. 2 I tend to assess my relationships in terms of profit and loss. 3 I believe everyone has a price and am cynical toward those who present themselves as virtuous. 4 I struggle to trust the words of others. 5 Few people know the real me. 6 Though I act charming, I feel nothing for others and don’t know what friendship is. Saltmarsh Ties It’s an open secret, at least among the old-timers in town, that Gellan Primewater runs the biggest smuggling operation in this section of the coast. You have contacts with him and his organization, enabling you to request an audience with him as necessary."
Soldier,"War has long been your life. You might have been part of a national army or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia. When you choose this background, work with your DM to determine which military organization you were a part of, how far through its ranks you progressed, and what kind of experiences you had during your military career. Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Intimidation Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, vehicles (land) Equipment: An insignia of rank, a trophy taken from a fallen enemy (a dagger, broken blade, or piece of a banner), a set of bone dice or deck of cards, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp Specialty During your time as a soldier, you had a specific role to play in your unit or army. Roll a d8 or choose from the options in the table below to determine your role: d8 Specialty d8 Specialty 1 Officer 5 Heal⁠er 2 Sc⁠out 6 Quartermaster 3 Infantry 7 Standard bearer 4 Cavalry 8 Support staff (cook, blacksmith, or the like) Feature: Military Rank You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized. Suggested Characteristics The horrors of war combined with the rigid discipline of military service leave their mark on all soldiers, shaping their ideals, creating strong bonds, and often leaving them scarred and vulnerable to fear, shame, and hat⁠red. d8 Personality Trait 1 I’m always polite and respectful. 2 I’m haunted by memories of war. I can’t get the images of violence out of my mind. 3 I’ve lost too many friends, and I’m slow to make new ones. 4 I’m full of inspiring and cautionary tales from my military experience relevant to almost every com⁠bat situation. 5 I can stare down a hell hound without flinching. 6 I enjoy being strong and like breaking things. 7 I have a crude sense of humor. 8 I face problems head-on. A simple, direct solution is the best path to success. d6 Ideal 1 Greater Good. Our lot is to lay down our lives in defense of others. (Good) 2 Responsibility. I do what I must and obey just authority. (Lawful) 3 Independence. When people follow orders blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny. (Chaotic) 4 Might. In life as in war, the stronger force wins. (Evil) 5 Live and Let Live. Ideals aren’t worth killing over or going to war for. (Neutral) 6 Nation. My city, nation, or people are all that matter. (Any) d6 Bond 1 I would still lay down my life for the people I served with. 2 Someone saved my life on the battlefield. To this day, I will never leave a friend behind. 3 My honor is my life. 4 I’ll never forget the crushing defeat my company suffered or the enemies who dealt it. 5 Those who fight beside me are those worth dying for. 6 I fight for those who cannot fight for themselves. d6 Flaw 1 The monstrous enemy we faced in battle still leaves me quivering with fear. 2 I have little respect for anyone who is not a proven warrior. 3 I made a terrible mistake in battle that cost many lives, and I would do anything to keep that mistake secret. 4 My hat⁠red of my enemies is blind and unreasoning. 5 I obey the law, even if the law causes misery. 6 I’d rather eat my armor than admit when I’m wrong."
Urban Bounty Hunter,"Before you became an adventurer, your life was already full of conflict and excitement, because you made a living tracking down people for pay. Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren’t a savage who follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You’re involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What’s more, you aren’t alone, as a bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help you succeed. You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of thieves’ guilds and street gangs. You might be a “velvet mask” bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. The community where you plied your trade might have been one of Faerûn’s great metropolises, such as Waterdeep or Baldur’s Gate, or a less populous location, perhaps Luskan or Yartar—any place that’s large enough to have a steady supply of potential quarries. As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn’t fit with the group’s objectives—but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets with the help of your companions. Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from among Deception, Insight, Persuasion, and Stealth Tool Proficiencies: Choose two from among one type of gaming set, one musical instrument, and thieves’ tools Equipment: A set of clothes appropriate to your duties and a pouch containing 20 gp Feature: Ear to the Ground You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen quarries move through. These people might be associated with the criminal underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, or members of high society. This connection comes in the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who provides information about the people and places of the local area. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the criminal background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your bounty hunter’s traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a bounty hunter. For instance, your bond might involve other bounty hunters or the organizations or individuals that employ you. Your ideal could be associated with your determination always to catch your quarry or your desire to maintain your reputation for being dependable."
Uthgardt Tribe Member,"Though you might have only recently arrived in civilized lands, you are no stranger to the values of cooperation and group effort when striving for supremacy. You learned these principles, and much more, as a member of an Uthgardt tribe. Your people have always tried to hold to the old ways. Tradition and taboo have kept the Uthgardt strong while the kingdoms of others have collapsed into chaos and ruin. But for the last few generations, some bands among the tribes were tempted to settle, make peace, trade, and even to build towns. Perhaps this is why Uthgar chose to raise up the totems among the people as living embodiments of his power. Perhaps they needed a reminder of who they were and from whence they came. The Chosen of Uthgar led bands back to the old ways, and most of your people abandoned the soft ways of civilization. You might have grown up in one of the tribes that had decided to settle down, and now that they have abandoned that path, you find yourself adrift. Or you might come from a segment of the Uthgardt that adheres to tradition, but you seek to bring glory to your tribe by achieving great things as a formidable adventurer. See the “Uthgardt Lands” section of chapter 2 for details on each tribe’s territory and its activities that will help you choose your affiliation. Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument or artisan’s tools Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A hunting trap, a totemic token or set of tattoos marking your loyalty to Uthgar and your tribal totem, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp Barbarian Tribes of Faerûn Though this section details the Uthgardt specifically, either it or the outlander background from the Player’s Handbook can be used for a character whose origin lies with one of the other barbarian tribes in Faerûn. You might be a fair-haired barbarian of the Reghed, dwelling in the shadow of the Reghed Glacier in the far North near Icewind Dale. You might also be of the nomadic Rashemi, noted for their savage berserkers and their masked witches. Perhaps you hail from one of the wood elf tribes in the Chondalwood, or the magic-hating human tribes of the sweltering jungles of Chult. Feature: Uthgardt Heritage You have an excellent knowledge of not only your tribe’s territory, but also the terrain and natural resources of the rest of the North. You are familiar enough with any wilderness area that you find twice as much food and water as you normally would when you forage there. Additionally, you can call upon the hospitality of your people, and those folk allied with your tribe, often including members of druid circles, tribes of nomadic elves, the Harpers, and the priesthoods devoted to the gods of the First Circle. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the outlander background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of an Uthgardt tribe. Even if you have left your tribe behind (at least for now), you hold to the traditions of your people. You will never cut down a still-living tree, and you may not countenance such an act being done in your presence. The Uthgardt ancestral mounds—great hills where the totem spirits were defeated by Uthgar and where the heroes of the tribes are interred—are sacred to you. Your bond is undoubtedly associated with your tribe or some aspect of Uthgardt philosophy or culture (perhaps even Uthgar himself). Your ideal is a personal choice that probably hews closely to the ethos of your people and certainly doesn’t contradict or compromise what being an Uthgardt stands for."
Volstrucker Agent,"The Volstrucker are a clandestine organization of arcane assassins and enforcers in the service of the Cerberus Assembly. Their operatives bear no official title, but are referred to in hushed tones as “scourgers” by residents of large Dwendalian cities such as Zadash and Rexxentrum. You are a Volstrucker agent. Your duty is to silence dissidents who would undermine the will of King Dwendal—and more importantly, the will of the Assembly. Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Stealth Tool Proficiencies: Poisoner’s kit Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A set of common clothes, a black cloak with a hood, a poisoner’s kit, and a pouch containing 10 gp Tragedy Happy people aren’t selected to join the Volstrucker. The Cerberus Assembly preys upon talented individuals who have been broken by tragedy—in some cases, tragedy that the Volstrucker has arranged for. A slightly broken mind is more easily reshaped and reeducated. Choose the tragedy that set you on this path, or roll on the Tragedies table. Tragedies d6 Tragedy 1 Familicide. Through deceit or manipulation, the Volstrucker convinced you to slaughter your own family. 2 Amnesia. You were forced to study magic so potent that it strained your mind beyond mortal limits, stealing away the memories of your past. 3 Capture. You were captured and tortured by agents of the Kryn Dynasty, and barely escaped. 4 Starvation. A terrible blight afflicted your rural village, and many of your friends and family members starved to death. You survived, but only barely. 5 Disfigurement. One of your arcane experiments went wrong and scarred or dismembered you so gravely that others now shun you. Only the Volstrucker showed you kindness after that day. 6 Vicissitude. You were once the scion of a wealthy family who lost their entire fortune in the blink of an eye. Feature: Shadow Network You have access to the Volstrucker shadow network, which allows you to communicate with other members of the order over long distances. If you write a letter in a special arcane ink, address it to a member of the Volstrucker, and cast it into a fire, the letter will burn to cinders and materialize whole again on the person of the agent you addressed it to. The ink used to send a letter across the shadow network is the same as that used by a wizard to scribe spells in a spellbook. Writing a letter in this ink costs 10 gp per page. Suggested Characteristics Agents of the Volstrucker are groomed to follow orders without question and to kill without mercy. The trauma that brings one into the order can fester even more strongly against the darkness of a Volstrucker agent’s assignments. Officially, no one ever leaves the order—but those desperate enough do whatever it takes to gain some measure of freedom. Volstrucker Agent Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 I prefer to keep my thoughts to myself. 2 I indulge vice in excess to quiet my conscience. 3 I’ve left emotion behind me.

Waterdhavian Noble,"You are a scion of one of the great noble families of Waterdeep. Human families who jealously guard their privilege and place in the City of Splendors, Waterdhavian nobles have a reputation across Faerûn for being eccentric, spoiled, venal, and, above all else, rich. Whether you are a shining example of the reason for this reputation or one who proves the rule by being an exception, people expect things of you when they know your surname and what it means. Your reasons for taking up adventuring likely involve your family in some way: Are you the family rebel, who prefers delving in filthy dungeons to sipping zzar at a ball? Or have you taken up sword or spell on your family’s behalf, ensuring that they have someone of renown to see to their legacy? Work with your DM to come up with the family you are part of —there are around seventy-five lineages in Waterdeep, each with its own financial interests, specialties, and schemes. You might be part of the main line of your family, possibly in line to become its leader one day. Or you might be one of any number of cousins, with less prestige but also less responsibility. Skill Proficiencies: History, Persuasion Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set or one musical instrument Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring or brooch, a scroll of pedigree, a skin of fine zzar or wine, and a purse containing 20 gp Feature: Kept in Style While you are in Waterdeep or elsewhere in the North, your house sees to your everyday needs. Your name and signet are sufficient to cover most of your expenses; the inns, taverns, and festhalls you frequent are glad to record your debt and send an accounting to your family’s estate in Waterdeep to settle what you owe. This advantage enables you to live a comfortable lifestyle without having to pay 2 gp a day for it, or reduces the cost of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle by that amount. You may not maintain a less affluent lifestyle and use the difference as income—the benefit is a line of credit, not an actual monetary reward. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the noble background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of a Waterdhavian family. Like other nobles, you were born and raised in a different world from the one that most folk know—one that grants you privilege but also calls you to fulfill a duty befitting your station. Your bond might be associated with your family alone, or it could be concerned with another noble house that sides with or opposes your own. Your ideal depends to some extent on how you view your role in the family, and how you intend to conduct yourself in the world at large as a representative of your house."
Wayfarer,"Ability Scores Dexterity, Wisdom, Charisma Feat Lucky Skill Proficiencies Insight and Stealth Tool Proficiency Thieves’ Tools Equipment Choose A or B: (A) 2 Daggers, Thieves’ Tools, Gaming Set (any), Bedroll, 2 Pouches, Traveler’s Clothes, 16 GP; or (B) 50 GP You grew up on the streets surrounded by similarly ill-fated castoffs, a few of them friends and a few of them rivals. You slept where you could and did odd jobs for food. At times, when the hunger became unbearable, you resorted to theft. Still, you never lost your pride and never abandoned hope. Fate is not yet finished with you."
Wildspacer,"You were raised in the void of Wildspace—home to asteroid miners, moon farmers, and other hardy folk. Perhaps you grew up in a far-flung settlement such as the Rock of Bral, or you spent your early years on the crew of a spelljamming ship, performing helpful chores such as swabbing the deck, loading and offloading cargo, and scraping barnacles off the hull. Whatever your history, life in Wildspace has toughened you so well that you are as brave as a miniature giant space hamster when it comes to facing the terrors and other challenges of the airless night. Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival Tool Proficiencies: Navigator’s tools, vehicles (space) Equipment: A belaying pin (club), a set of traveler’s clothes, a grappling hook, 50 feet of hempen rope, and a pouch containing 10 gp Close Encounter You had a harrowing encounter with one of Wildspace’s many terrors. You escaped with your life, but the encounter left you with a scar or two, or perhaps a recurring nightmare. Roll on the Close Encounter table to determine which creature nearly got the best of you. Creatures marked with an asterisk appear in Boo’s Astral Menagerie ; the others are described in the Monster Manual . Close Encounter d10 Creature 1 Beholder 2 Cosmic horror * 3 Feyr * 4 Lunar dragon * 5 Mind flayer 6 Neh-thalggu * 7 Neogi * 8 Space clown * 9 Vampirate 10 Void scavver * Feature: Wildspace Adaptation You gain the Tough feat from the Player’s Handbook . In addition, you learned how to adapt to zero gravity. Being weightless doesn’t give you disadvantage on any of your melee attack rolls."
Witchlight Hand,"You crept into the Witchlight Carnival as a child or youth and never looked back, earning a place among those who work behind the scenes to keep the carnival in business. As a hand, you work hard and party hard. The carnival has borne you to many fantastic worlds, circling back around to your home world once every eight years, but you know almost nothing about these worlds because you spend all your time in the carnival. You know the other hands well, but the carnival’s owners—Mister Witch and Mister Light—remain mysterious to you even after all these years. Maybe you joined the carnival to escape a dismal life at home, or maybe you were enchanted by the idea of visiting new places or the dream of becoming one of the carnival’s star attractions. Now that you’re older, carnival life has lost some of its appeal. The daily routine has grown tedious, the cyclical nature of the carnival’s journey monotonous. The carnival no longer fills your heart with a sense of wonder. Perhaps greater adventures await you beyond the carnival’s gates. Skill Proficiencies: Performance, Sleight of Hand Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit or one type of musical instrument Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A disguise kit or a musical instrument of your choice, a deck of cards, a carnival uniform or costume, one trinket (determined by rolling on the Feywild Trinkets table), and a pouch containing 8 gp Carnival Companion Over the years, you have earned the friendship of another carnival fixture. Roll a d8 and consult the Carnival Companion table to determine whom or what you’ve befriended, or you can choose an option that you like. Work with your DM to flesh out this friendship. This companion hangs around you while you’re in the carnival, but it won’t voluntarily leave the carnival. The DM can use the Witchlight hand stat block in chapter 1 to represent hands, performers, and animal trainers who serve as carnival companions. Statistics for the other companions appear in the Monster Manual . Carnival Companion d8 Companion 1 Old, cantankerous Witchlight hand 2 Young, impressionable Witchlight hand 3 Performer (such as an acrobat, a clown, or a musician) 4 Retired performer 5 Seasoned animal trainer 6 Old blink dog 7 Cheery sprite 8 Harmless, magical wisp of light (no stat block required) that has a flying speed of 30 feet, can hover, and sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet Feature: Carnival Fixture The Witchlight Carnival provides you with free, modest lodging and food. In addition, you may wander about the carnival and partake of its many wonders at no cost to you, provided you don’t disrupt its shows or cause any other trouble. Character Traits As the players choose backgrounds for their characters, they can use the following tables to help determine their characters’ personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Players can use these tables instead of the ones that appear in the Player’s Handbook , or they can mix and match them. If a rolled result doesn’t make sense for a character, the player can roll again or choose a more appropriate entry on the table. These tables, while optional, are well suited to Feywild-themed adventures and are ideal for any character who has the feylost or Witchlight hand background. Personality Traits d8 Trait 1 I’m haunted by fey laughter that only I can hear, though I know it’s just my mind playing tricks on me. 2 Like a nomad, I can’t settle down in one place for very long. 3 Good music makes me weep like a baby. 4 Wherever I go, I try to bring a little of the warmth and tranquility of home with me. 5 I have never lost my childlike sense of wonder. 6 When I have a new idea, I get wildly excited about it until I come up with another, better idea. 7 I live by my own set of weird and wonderful rules. 8 I can’t bring myself to trust most adults. Ideals d8 Ideal 1 Friendship. I never leave a friend behind. (Good) 2 Empathy. No creature should be made to suffer. (Good) 3 Wanderlust. I prefer to take the less traveled path. (Chaotic) 4 Changeability. Change is good, which is why I live by an ever-changing set of rules. (Chaotic) 5 Honor. A deal is a deal, and I would never break one. (Lawful) 6 Rule of Three. Everything in the multiverse happens in threes. I see the “rule of three” everywhere. (Lawful) 7 Obsession. I won’t let go of a grudge. (Evil) 8 Greed. I will do whatever it takes to get what I want, regardless of the harm it might cause. (Evil) Bonds d8 Bond 1 I would never break my word. 2 I find magic in all its forms to be compelling. The more magical a place, the more I am drawn to it. 3 I do what I can to protect the natural world. 4 A trusted friend is the most important thing in the multiverse to me. 5 I can’t bring myself to harm a Fey creature, either because I consider myself one or because I fear the repercussions. 6 The Witchlight Carnival feels like home to me. 7 I’m drawn to the Feywild and long to return there, if only for a short while. 8 I feel indebted to Mister Witch and Mister Light for giving me a home and a purpose. Flaws d8 Flaw 1 I easily lose track of time. My poor sense of time means I’m always late. 2 I think the whole multiverse is out to get me. 3 I’m always operating under a tight timeline, and I’m obsessed with keeping everything on schedule. 4 I’m a kleptomaniac who covets shiny, sparkling treasure. 5 I’m forgetful. Sometimes I can’t remember even the simplest things. 6 I never give away anything for free and always expect something in return. 7 I have many vices and tend to indulge them. 8 I’m always changing my mind—well, almost always."
Witherbloom Student,"You filled your childhood with rudimentary alchemical experiments, all in the hope of becoming a student of Witherbloom College. The life sciences are the focus of your reading, which include biology and necromancy. Brewing strange concoctions with medicinal properties, exploring the anatomies of monsters, and cataloging swamp flora are the kinds of studies you might pursue at Witherbloom College. Skill Proficiencies: Nature, Survival Tool Proficiencies: Herbalism kit Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A bottle of black ink, an ink pen, a book about plant identification, an iron pot, an herbalism kit, a school uniform, and a pouch containing 15 gp Feature: Witherbloom Initiate You gain the Strixhaven Initiate feat and must choose Witherbloom within it. In addition, if you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, the spells on the Witherbloom Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.) Witherbloom Spells Spell Level Spells 1st Cure Wounds , Inflict Wounds 2nd Lesser Restoration , Wither and Bloom 3rd Revivify , Vampiric Touch 4th Blight , Death Ward 5th Antilife Shell , Greater Restoration Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. Your Witherbloom spells might rely on material components or a spellcasting focus drawn from the swamp environment of Witherbloom, and your spells might take on an appearance suggesting those natural elements. Spectral shapes of swamp animals or plants might form amid your spell effects. Building a Witherbloom Character Druids and warlocks make up most of Witherbloom’s student body. A few wizards (mostly those who study the School of Necromancy) and clerics (including those with the Divine Domains of Life or Nature) also find their home in Witherbloom. A number of rangers and barbarians study at Witherbloom as well, and some rogues learn how to create and use poisons during their studies at this college. Suggested Characteristics. Students of Witherbloom College are equally likely to be found picking herbs for a healing tincture or riding zombified swamp beasts through the bayou. The Witherbloom Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character. Witherbloom Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 I love brewing up a new recipe, even if some might be repulsed by my choice of ingredients. Or the final product. Or both. 2 My fashion sense is like my garden: withered, black, and weird. 3 I’m going to befriend every single monster in this swamp if it’s the last thing I do. 4 Everything in this world dies eventually. The question is, what will you do with the time you have left? 5 I know we just met, but when you die, may I have your bones? For research. 6 Don’t interrupt me; I’m brooding. Witherbloom Trinkets. When you make your character, you may roll once on the Witherbloom Trinkets table, instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player’s Handbook , for your starting trinket. Witherbloom Trinkets d6 Trinket 1 A black bird-shaped mask, trimmed with glowing green thread 2 A set of rabbit bones 3 A pair of thick knee-high waders, stained with muck and moss 4 A slimy green tentacle, which occasionally wriggles 5 A notebook containing waterproof paper 6 A necklace of five small vials, each filled with luminescent white liquid"
